<h1><span class='add'>8. Speech</span></h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh1'></a>He who says he has not done that which he has done, and he who is a liar, will go to hell; both these men alike, having gone to the next world, will be in a degraded state.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh2'></a>Every man that is born, and who speaks wicked words, will cut himself with the axe of speech that has been born <span class='add'>(with him)</span>.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh3'></a>He who praises a man who ought to be blamed, and who blames a man worthy of praise, brings sin <span class='add'>(upon himself)</span> with his mouth; he who is sinful will not find happiness.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh4'></a>He who in this world loses his wealth at dice is a little sinful; he whose mind is evilly disposed towards the Tathāgata is an extremely sinful person.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh5'></a>He who in this world uses his speech and mind in reviling an Ariya will go for ten millions <span class='add'>(of lives)</span> to the Nirabbudas hell, and for a thousand and forty-one to the Abbudas.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh6'></a>He who in the sinfulness of his mind accuses one who is not sinful of guilt, increases his own punishment in hell. He who has the might <span class='add'>(of wisdom)</span> makes no wrong use of his speech; not even in his mind does he imagine strife.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh7'></a>They whose minds are perverted by false doctrines <span class='add'>(heresies)</span>, and who renounce the teaching and the mode of living of the elect <i lang='san' translate='no'>(Ariyas)</i> and Arhats, are destroyed on account of their wicked deeds as is the reed by its seed.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh8'></a>One must only speak what is right, and must not speak evilly; from wicked words comes evil, one ought consequently to use proper language.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh9'></a>The fool speaks wickedly, and it is by his speech that he is held in bondage; when one uses this kind of language and rejects the other, him I call not a sage.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh10'></a>The Bhixus, who watch over their speech, who speak leisurely and without arrogance, who, in possession of the Law, do teach its value, their speech is pleasing.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh11'></a>Well-spoken language is the principal thing, says the Ariya; to speak kindly and not unkindly is the second <span class='add'>(best thing)</span>; to speak the truth and not lies is the third; to speak what is right and not what is futile is the fourth.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh12'></a>He who speaks words which bring him no grief and which will do no harm to his neighbour, speaks well.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh13'></a>Let one speak pleasing words, which, when he has spoken them, bring joy to his neighbour, and, being received with pleasure, cause him to commit no sin.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh14'></a>To speak the truth is <span class='add'>(like)</span> amrita; truth cannot be surpassed. The truth is holding fast to what is good and to what is right, say the righteous.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh15'></a>The words which the Buddha speaks and which remove all misery are words of truth; those that lead to nirvāṇa cannot be surpassed.</p>
