<h1><span class='add'>11. The Śramana</span></h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh1'></a>Cast off desires, O Brāhmana, stop the stream <span class='add'>(of birth)</span> by thy earnestness; he who is not able to cast away all desires cannot find the one <span class='add'>(perfect state)</span>.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh2'></a>The irresolute and careless Parivrādjakas only heap up sins again and again; he who is diligent and earnest knows how to do that which ought to be done.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh3'></a>An irresolute act, badly performed penance, an unrighteous life, bring no great profit.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh4'></a>If an arrow is badly grasped, it cuts the hand; the Śramana who performs his duties badly is on the way to hell.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh5'></a>If an arrow is properly grasped, it does not cut the hand; in like manner, the Śramana who exactly performs his duties is on the way to nirvāṇa.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh6'></a>The ignorant Śramana, who finds it hard to cross <span class='add'>(the stream)</span>, hard to be patient, who is filled with the many sorrows that his faint-heartedness brings him:</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh7'></a>The Śramana whose life is like this, is subject to the ever-recurring grief, of which he cannot free himself, of one who is filled with indecision.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh8'></a>He who is a bad priest, who delights in sin, and who, as a layman, is given to sinful deeds, addicted to everything that is bad, he lays up for himself the wretchedness of regeneration.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh9'></a>Many of those who wear the patched saffron-coloured gown are unrestrained and delight in wickedness; these bad men go to perdition.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh10'></a>He who, breaking all his vows, <span class='add'>(is held)</span> as is a sāla-tree by a creeper, brings himself to that state to which his enemy would like to bring him.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh11'></a>Though one's hair may be grey, one is not for that reason admitted among the elders; he has reached old age, but he is called “Old-in-vain.”</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh12'></a>He who is virtuous, who has cast off sin, who is a Bramachārin, and free of all <span class='add'>(impurities)</span>, he is called “an elder.”</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh13'></a>He whose conduct is bad and who speaks lies, though his head be shaven, is not a Śramana. They who live in ignorance and lust, how can they be Śramanas?</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh14'></a>He whose conduct is bad and who speaks lies, though his head be shaven, is not a Śramana ; he who has “quieted” sin, him the wise know to be a Śramana.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh15'></a>He whose conduct is bad and who speaks lies, though his head be shaven, is not a Śramana; but he who, having distinguished all sins, great and small, does keep away from them and does “quiet” sin, he is called “a Śramana.”</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh16'></a>He who has “cast off sin” is a Brāhmana ; he who does “quiet” sin is a Śramana; he who has cast off all his impurities is for that reason called a priest.</p>
