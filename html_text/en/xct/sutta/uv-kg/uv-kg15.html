<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh1'></a>It is the teaching of the Buddha, that whoever <span class='add'>(commences by)</span> reflecting on the operation of breathing, and who goes on through the different stages <span class='add'>(of meditation)</span>, his mind well composed, will reach perfection, as the sun and moon, when free from clouds, illuminate the whole world.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh2'></a>He who, standing, sitting, and sleeping, keeps both body and mind under control, such a thoughtful and well-controlled Bhixu will find the above-mentioned and other blessings; and if he has obtained the above-mentioned and the other blessings, he will not go to where is the lord of death.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh3'></a>He who continually reflects on what appertains to the body, and has well under control the six senses <i lang='san' translate='no'>(āyatanas)</i>, and who is always well composed, knows the extinction of sorrow.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh4'></a>He who continually reflects on what appertains to the body in all its different shapes, on being without self, without attachment for the “mine,” will not care for self; he will have no attachment for the “mine:” in this manner will the Bhixu swiftly cross over from the regions of desire.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh5'></a>He who is thoughtful, wise, well composed, happy, and pure, and who attends carefully at all times to this law, will, I declare, cross over from birth and old age.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh6'></a>Thus learning to be always on his guard, the wise, thoughtful, and diligent Bhixu, after having cast off all bonds, finds by this means the destruction of sorrow <i lang='san' translate='no'>(nirvāṇa)</i>.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh7'></a>They who are awake can watch better than they who sleep, I tell you; it is better to watch than to sleep, for he who watches has no fear.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh8'></a>He who is watchful and diligent is safe day and night, and he will find the end of pain <i lang='san' translate='no'>(kleśā)</i> in the longed-for cessation of death <i lang='san' translate='no'>(nirvāṇa)</i>.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh9'></a>They who day and night are reflecting on the Buddha, and who go to the Buddha for a refuge, these men have the profits of mankind.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh10'></a>They who day and night are reflecting on the law <i lang='san' translate='no'>(dharma)</i>, and who go to the law for a refuge, these men have the profits of mankind.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh11'></a>They who day and night are reflecting on the church <i lang='san' translate='no'>(sangha)</i>), and who go to the church for a refuge, these men have the profits of mankind.</p>
