<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh1'></a>He who, though having ornamental apparel, is righteous, controlled, quiet, restrained, leading a life of holiness <i lang='san' translate='no'>(brahmacharya)</i>, who neither harms or kills any living thing, he is a Brāhmana, a Śramana, he is a Bhixu.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh2'></a>It is not by nakedness, by long hair, by dirt, by fasting, or by sleeping on the bare ground, not by dust and dirt, or by devoting oneself to sitting motionless, that men become pure and leave their doubts behind.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh3'></a>Whatever Śramanas and Brāhmanas there be who have passions, they will not put an end to sinfulness <i lang='san' translate='no'>(the āsravas)</i>, and will experience the suffering of passing from life to life <span class='add'>(transmigrating)</span>.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh4'></a>Whatever Śramanas and Brāhmanas there be who have passions, they will not put an end to sensation <i lang='san' translate='no'>(vedanā)</i>, and will experience the suffering of passing from life to life.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh5'></a>Whatever Śramanas and Brāhmanas there be who have passions, and who have but a foolish object in view, they will experience the suffering of passing from life to life.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh6'></a>Whatever Śramanas and Brāhmanas there be who have passions, the foolish, stupid men will experience the suffering of passing from life to life.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh7'></a>Whatever Śramanas and Brāhmanas there be who have passions, they will not find the blessed ideal <i lang='san' translate='no'>(nirvāṇa)</i>, and will experience the suffering of passing from life to life.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh8'></a>O fool! what is the use of thy long locks? what is the use of thy garment of skin? Within thee there abides darkness; the outside thou makest clean.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh9'></a>One does not become a Brāhmana by his family, by his long locks, by his lineage; he who possesses the law of truth and who is pure, he is a Brāhmana.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh10'></a>One does not become a Brāhmana by his family, by his long locks, by his lineage; he who casts away all sins both great and small, him, because he has cast away sin, I call a Brāhmana.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh11'></a>A man is not a Śramana on account of his shaven head, a man is not a Brāhmana because he says “Om!” He who knows what is virtue, and who is pure, he is a Brāhmana.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh12'></a>A man is not a Śramana on account of his shaven head; a man is not a Brāhmana because he says “Om!” He who casts away all sins both great and small, he, because he has cast away sins, is a Śramana, a Brāhmana.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh13'></a>One does not become pure by washing, as do the common of mortals in this world; he who casts away every sin both great and small, he, because he has cast away sins, is a Śramana, a Brāhmana.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh14'></a>He who has cast off all sinfulness, who devotes himself to continual reflection, who has the perfect enlightenment of the destruction of all attachment, he in the <span class='add'>(three)</span> worlds is a Brāhmana.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh15'></a>The Brāhmana who has cast off all sinfulness, who is without hypocrisy, and who leads a pure life, has reached the perfection <span class='add'>(set forth in)</span> the Vedas; his life is a life of holiness <i lang='san' translate='no'>(brahmacharya)</i>, and when he does speak, his speech is holy.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh16'></a>He who is not given to deceiving, who is without selfishness, who is without passions, without expectation, who has conquered hatred, who is on the way to nirvāṇa <span class='add'>(the extinction of sorrow)</span>, he is a Brāhmana, a Śramana, he is a Bhixu.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh17'></a>He who has been born of woman, if he has great possessions, he may be called “Bhovadi,” but I call him not a Brāhmana; he who possesses nothing, who accepts nothing, him I call a Brāhmana.</p>

<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh22'></a>He who no longer dwells among either the clergy or the laity, who has few desires, who frequents not houses, he, I declare, is a Brāhmana.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh23'></a>He for whom there are no pleasures in the future, who feels no pain on account of those he has left behind, who has thrown off the bond of voluptuousness, who has conquered in the fight <span class='add'>(against Māra)</span>, he, I declare, is a Brāhmana.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh24'></a>He for whom there are no pleasures in the future, who feels no pain on account of those he has left behind, who is immaculate, dispassionate, without sorrow, he, I declare, is a Brāhmana.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh25'></a>He who nourishes not the smallest desire, who is subdued, who is devoted to <span class='add'>(acquiring)</span> the chief thing <i lang='san' translate='no'>(nirvāṇa)</i>, who has destroyed sinfulness <i lang='san' translate='no'>(āsravas)</i>, who is cleansed from stains, he, I declare, is a Brāhmana.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh26'></a>He for whom there is neither this side nor that side, who has reached the end of all conditions, he, I declare, is a Brāhmana.</p>

<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh30'></a>He who has cast off both virtue and vice, who is divested of everything, who is without passion <i lang='san' translate='no'>(rāga)</i>, at peace, he, I declare, is a Brāhmana.</p>

<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh83'></a><span class='add'>(387, 2nd part)</span>. The sun shines by day, the moon shines by night, continually, day and night, does the luminous <span class='add'>(form of the)</span> Buddha shine.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh84'></a>As Brāhmanas and the like have left behind everything that is disagreeable, as my mind has consequently left behind <span class='add'>(all passions)</span>, I have truly put an end to all pettiness.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh85'></a>When the ardent, meditative Brāhmana has perfectly understood the <span class='add'>(different)</span> conditions <i lang='san' translate='no'>(dharma)</i> and their causes <span class='add'>(the twelve nidānas)</span>, and when these ideas have</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh86'></a>When the ardent, meditative Brāhmana has perfectly understood suffering and its cause, and when this idea <i lang='san' translate='no'>(dharma)</i> has become perfectly clear to him, then he casts away every particle of perplexity.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh87'></a>When the ardent, meditative Brāhmana has discovered the destruction of sensation <i lang='san' translate='no'>(vedanā)</i>, and when this idea has become perfectly clear to him, then he casts away every particle of perplexity.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh88'></a>When the ardent, meditative Brāhmana has discovered the cessation of all causes <i lang='san' translate='no'>(hetu)</i>, and <span class='add'>(when)</span> this idea has become perfectly clear to him, then he casts away every particle of perplexity.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh89'></a>When the ardent, meditative Brāhmana has discovered the cessation of sinfulness <i lang='san' translate='no'>(āsravas)</i>, and when this idea has become perfectly clear to him, then he casts away every particle of perplexity.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh90'></a>When to the ardent, meditative Brāhmana all these ideas have become perfectly clear, he stands lighting up all the worlds <span class='add'>(or the whole world)</span> as the sun illuminates the sky.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh91'></a>When to the ardent, meditative Brāhmana, who by knowledge has become emancipated from all attachment <i lang='san' translate='no'>(yoga)</i>, all these ideas have become perfectly clear, he stands, having dispelled the hosts of Māra <span class='add'>(like the sun that illuminates the sky?)</span>.</p>
