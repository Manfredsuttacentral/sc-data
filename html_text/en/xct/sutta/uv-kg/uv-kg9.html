<h1><span class='add'>9. Deeds</span></h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh1'></a>The man who gives up the one <span class='add'>(great)</span> law <span class='add'>(i.e., truth)</span>, the means of gaining <span class='add'>(happiness in)</span> the other world, and who speaks lies, there is no evil that he will not do.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh2'></a>Better it would be that a man should eat a lump of flaming iron than that one who is unrestrained and who has broken his vows should live on the charity of the land.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh3'></a>If thou art filled with the dread of suffering, if there is naught agreeable for thee in suffering, do then no evil thing openly, or even in secret.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh4'></a>If thou hast done evil deeds, or if thou wouldst do them, thou mayest arise and run where'er thou wilt, but thou canst not free thyself of thy suffering.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh5'></a>There exists no spot on the earth, or in the sky, or in the sea, neither is there any in the mountain-clefts, where an <span class='add'>(evil)</span> deed does not bring trouble <span class='add'>(to the doer)</span>.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh6'></a>When one has looked at those around him and has seen their wicked deeds, let him not do likewise; walk not in the way of sin.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh7'></a>He who commits crimes, who uses false measures, who hurts men, or who does any other similar deeds, will by walking in this path fall into a precipice.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh8'></a>Whatsoever a man has done, whether it be virtuous or sinful deeds, there are none that are of little importance; they all bear some kind of fruit.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh9'></a>As long as men are united, so long will they be the conquerors; but if they would be victorious by other means, they will find out that they will be conquered.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh10'></a>The fool who sees not this walks on in his wicked way, but he who does evil will find out his <span class='add'>(mistake)</span> in the other world.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh11'></a>The fool sees not that his evil deeds, when they shall have matured, will still be burning. Hereafter his deeds will torment him as if burnt by fire.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh12'></a>The fool of little understanding treats himself as he would an enemy; he does evil deeds which will bear burning fruit.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh13'></a>The deed which harms, and of which the reward is received with tears and a downcast face, that deed is not well done.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh14'></a>The deed which harms not, and of which the reward is received with joy and happiness, that deed is well done.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh15'></a>When a man in the pursuit of his pleasure accomplishes an evil deed, it brings smiles to his face; but when his evil deed has ripened, it brings him sorrow.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh16'></a>Surely an evil deed does not turn on a sudden like milk; it is like fire smouldering in the ashes, which burns the fool.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh17'></a>An evil deed kills not instantly, as does a sword, but it follows the evil-doer <span class='add'>(even)</span> into the next world.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh18'></a>How burning is <span class='add'>(an evil deed)</span> when it has arrived at maturity, the evil-doers will find out in the other world.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh19'></a>As iron, when the rust doth take hold of it, is eaten by it, so in like manner is the heedless man brought into the evil way by his own deed.</p>
