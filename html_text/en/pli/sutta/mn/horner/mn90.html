<p><a class='bd' id='bd1'></a><a class='wp' id='wp1'></a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard:</span> At one time the Lord was staying near Ujuññā in the deer-park at Kaṇṇakatthala. At that time King Pasenadi <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en308'></a>of Kosala had arrived at Ujuññā on some business or other. Then King Pasenadi addressed a certain man, saying: “Come you, my good man, approach the Lord; having approached, in my name salute the Lord's feet with your head and ask whether he is well, not indisposed, of bodily vigour, strong, abiding in comfort, and say: ‘Revered sir, King Pasenadi salutes the Lord's feet with his head, and asks whether he is well, not indisposed, of bodily vigour, strong, abiding in comfort’; and then speak thus: ‘Revered sir, today after the meal, when he has had breakfast, King Pasenadi is expecting to come to see the Lord.’” “Yes, sire,” and that man, having answered King Pasenadi in assent, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd2'></a>As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, that man spoke thus to the Lord: “Revered sir, King Pasenadi salutes the Lord's feet with his head, and asks whether he is well, not indisposed, of bodily vigour, strong, abiding in comfort. And he speaks thus: ‘Revered sir, today after the meal when he has had breakfast, King Pasenadi is expecting to come to see the Lord.’”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd3'></a>The sisters Somā and Sakulā heard: ‘Today after the meal when he has had breakfast, King Pasenadi is expecting to go to see the Lord.’ Then the sisters Somā and Sakulā, having approached the place where King Pasenadi was eating, spoke thus: “Well then, sire, in our names salute the Lord's feet with your head and ask whether he is well, not indisposed, of bodily vigour, strong, abiding in comfort, saying: ‘Revered sir, the sisters Somā and Sakulā salute the Lord's feet with their heads and ask whether he is well, not indisposed, of bodily vigour, strong, abiding in comfort.’”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd4'></a>Then after the meal when King Pasenadi had eaten his breakfast, he approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, King Pasenadi spoke thus to the Lord: “Revered sir, the sisters Somā and Sakulā with their heads salute the Lord's feet and ask whether he is well, not indisposed, of bodily vigour, strong, abiding in comfort.” “But how is it, sire, that the sisters Somā and Sakulā were not able to send another messenger?” “Revered sir, the sisters Somā and Sakulā heard: ‘Today after the meal when he has had breakfast, King Pasenadi is expecting to go to see the Lord.’ Then, revered sir, the sisters Somā and Sakulā having approached me in the place where I was eating, spoke thus: <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en309'></a>‘Well then, sire, in our names salute the Lord's feet with your head and ask whether he is well, not indisposed, of bodily vigour, strong, abiding in comfort, saying: ‘Revered sir, the sisters Somā and Sakulā salute the Lord's feet with their heads and ask whether he is well, not indisposed, of bodily vigour, strong, abiding in comfort.’” “May the sisters Somā and Sakulā be happy, sire.”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd5'></a>Then King Pasenadi spoke thus to the Lord: “I have heard this about you, revered sir: ‘The recluse Gotama speaks thus: “There is neither a recluse nor a brahman who, all-knowing, all-seeing, can claim all-embracing knowledge-and-vision, this situation does not exist.”’ Revered sir, those who speak thus: ‘The recluse Gotama speaks thus: “There is neither a recluse nor a brahman who, all-knowing, all-seeing, can claim all-embracing knowledge-and-vision, this situation does not exist.”’ I hope that these, revered sir, speak what was spoken by the Lord, that they do not misrepresent the Lord by what is not fact, that they explain <i>Dhamma</i> according to <i>Dhamma,</i> and that no reasoned thesis gives occasion for contempt? “Those, sire, who speak thus:: ‘The recluse Gotama speaks thus: “There is neither a recluse nor a brahman who, all-knowing, all-seeing, can claim all-embracing knowledge-and-vision, this situation does not exist.”’ these do not speak as I spoke but are misrepresenting me with what is not true, with what is not fact.”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd6'></a>Then King Pasenadi addressed the commander-in-chief, Viḍūḍabha, saying: “Now, who was it, commander-in-chief, that brought this subject of conversation into the palace?” “The brahman Sañjaya of the Ākāsa clan, sire.” Then King Pasenadi summoned a man and said: “Come you, my good man, in my name summon the brahman Sañjaya of the Ākāsa clan, saying: ‘King Pasenadi, revered sir, is summoning you.’” “Yes, your majesty,” and when this man had answered King Pasenadi in assent he approached the brahman Sañjaya of the Ākāsa clan; and having approached, he spoke thus to the brahman Sañjaya: “King Pasenadi is summoning you, revered sir.”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd7'></a>Then King Pasenadi spoke thus to the Lord: “Could it be, revered sir, that people might have transferred to quite another topic something (originally) said by the Lord in reference to something else? In regard to what, revered sir, does the Lord claim to have spoken the words?” “I, sire, claim to have spoken the words thus: ‘There is neither a <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en310'></a>recluse nor a brahman, who at one and the same time can know all, can see all, this situation does not exist.’” “Revered sir, the Lord speaks causally, and it is in reference to cause, revered sir, that the Lord says: ‘There is neither a recluse nor a brahman, who at one and the same time can know all, can see all, this situation does not exist.’”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd8'></a>These, revered sir, are the four castes: nobles, brahmans, merchants and workers. Now, revered sir, could there be any distinction, any difference, between these four castes?” “These are, sire, the four castes: nobles, brahmans, merchants and workers. Among these four castes, sire, two are pointed to as chief: the nobles and the brahmans, that is to say in the way of addressing them, rising up from one's seat for them, saluting them with joined palms and rendering them service.” “I, revered sir, am not asking the Lord about the here and now; revered sir, I am asking the Lord about a future state. These, revered sir, are the four castes: nobles, brahmans, merchants and workers. Now, revered sir, could there be any distinction, any difference between these four castes?”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd9'></a><span class='note' hidden=''>bd: This could be seen as 'a Noble Fivefold Gradual Path'.</span> “Sire, there are these five qualities for striving. What five? As to this, sire, <span class='add'>[1]</span> a monk has faith; he has faith in the awakening of the Tathāgata, and thinks: ‘Indeed this is the Lord, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, endowed with knowledge and (right) conduct, Well-farer, knower of the worlds, incomparable charioteer of men to be tamed, teacher of devas and men, the Awakened One, the Lord.’ <span class='add'>[2]</span> He is well, in good health, endowed with a good digestion, not over-cool, not over-hot, but of a middle kind suitable for striving. <span class='add'>[3]</span> He is not fraudulent, not deceitful, but shows himself as he really is to the Teacher or the learned among his fellow Brahma-farers. <span class='add'>[4]</span> He dwells with energy stirred up for getting rid of unskilled states, for arousing skilled states, steadfast, firm in advance, persevering amid skilled states. <span class='add'>[5]</span> He is one of wisdom endowed with wisdom leading to (the cutting off of) rise and fall, with ariyan discrimination leading to the complete destruction of anguish. These, sire, are the five qualities for striving.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd10'></a>These, sire, are the four castes: nobles, brahmans, merchants and workers. These might be possessed of these five qualities for striving. For a long time that would be for their welfare and happiness.” “These, revered sir, are the four castes: nobles, brahmans, merchants and workers; and these might be possessed of the five qualities for striving. But, revered sir, might there be among them here any distinction, any difference?” “I, sire, here speak of a divergence in striving. It is as if there might be, sire, among elephants, or horses, or oxen to be tamed two elephants, two horses, or two oxen that were well tamed, well trained and two that were not tamed, not trained. What do you think about <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en311'></a>this, sire? Would those two elephants, or horses, or oxen that were to be tamed and that were well tamed, well trained, would these, on being tamed, reach tamed capacity, would they, being tamed, attain tamed rank?” “Yes, revered sir.” “But those two elephants, or horses, or oxen that were to be tamed, but that were neither tamed nor trained, would these, not being tamed, reach tamed capacity and would they, not being tamed, attain tamed rank, as do the two elephants, or horses, or oxen to be tamed that were well tamed, well trained?” “No, revered sir.”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd11'></a>“Even so, sire, that which may be achieved by faith, by good health, by honesty and absence of deceit, by output of energy, by wisdom, that one of no faith, of poor health, fraudulent and deceitful, lazy, weak in wisdom, could attain it, this situation does not exist.” “Revered sir, the Lord speaks causally, and it is in reference to cause, revered sir, that the Lord speaks.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd12'></a>These, revered sir, are the four castes: nobles, brahmans, merchants and workers. These might be possessed of the five qualities for striving and if they made the proper efforts would there be between them, revered sir, any distinction, any difference?” “I, sire, here speak of no difference, that is to say in freedom as against freedom. It is as though a man, sire, bringing dry sticks from a teak tree, were to produce a fire and heat were to result. Then another man, bringing dry sticks from a sāl-tree, were to produce a fire and heat were to result. Then another man, bringing dry sticks from a mango-tree, were to produce a fire and heat were to result. Then another man, bringing dry sticks from a fig tree, were to produce a fire and heat were to result. What do you think about this, sire? Because of the different woods used for the fires, would there be any difference in what is produced, in flame as against flame, in hue as against hue, in brilliance as against brilliance?” “No, revered sir.” “Even so it is, sire, with heat created by energy, produced by striving. I do not speak of any difference there, that is in freedom as against freedom.” “Revered sir, the Lord speaks causally, and it is in reference to cause that the Lord speaks.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd13'></a>But, honoured sir, are there <i>devas?”</i> <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en312'></a>“How can you, sire, speak thus: ‘But, revered sir, are there <i>devas?’</i>” “Be it that these <i>devas,</i> revered sir, are returners to a state of being such or so, or be it that they are not returners to a state of being such or so?” “Sire, whatever <i>devas</i> have been malevolent are returners to a state of being such or so; whatever <i>devas</i> have not been malevolent are not returners to a state of being such or so.”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd14'></a>When this had been said, the commander-in-chief, Viḍūḍabha, spoke thus to the Lord: “Revered sir, can those <i>devas</i> that are malevolent and are returners to a state of being such or so, drive away or banish from that place those devas that have not been malevolent and are not returners to a state of being such or so?” Then it occurred to the venerable Ānanda: “This Viḍūḍabha, the commander-in-chief, is a son of King Pasenadi; I am the Lord's son. This is a time when son might confer with son.” So the venerable Ānanda addressed Viḍūḍabha, the commander-in-chief, saying: “Well now, commander-in-chief, on this point I will ask you something in return. Answer exactly as it seems right to you.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd15'></a>What do you think about this, commander-in-chief? As far as the realm of King Pasenadi (extends) and there where King Pasenadi holds dominion and sway, is King Pasenadi able to drive away, or banish, from that place a recluse, or a brahman whether he is meritorious or not meritorious, whether he is a Brahma-farer, or not a Brahma-farer?” “Good sir, as far as the realm of King Pasenadi (extends) and there where King Pasenadi holds dominion and sway, King Pasenadi is able to drive away, or banish, from that place a recluse, or a brahman whether he is meritorious or not or not meritorious, whether he is a Brahma-farer, or not a Brahma-farer.”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd16'></a>“What do you think about this, commander-in-chief? As far as the realm of King Pasenadi does not (extend) and there where King Pasenadi holds no dominion or sway, is King Pasenadi able to drive away, or banish, from that place a recluse, or a brahman whether he is meritorious or not meritorious, whether he is a Brahma-farer or not a Brahma-farer?” “Good sir, as far as the realm of King Pasenadi does not (extend) and there where King Pasenadi holds no dominion or sway, King Pasenadi is not able to drive away, or banish, from that place a recluse, or a brahman whether he is meritorious or not meritorious, whether he is a Brahma-farer or not a Brahma-farer.”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd17'></a>“What do you think about, this, commander-in-chief? Have you heard of the <i>devas</i> of the Thirty-Three?” <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en313'></a>“Yes, good sir, I have heard of the devas of the Thirty-Three and the good King Pasenadi has also heard of the <i>devas</i> of the Thirty-Three.”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd18'></a>“What do you think about this, commander-in-chief? Is King Pasenadi able to drive away, or banish, from that place the devas of the Thirty-Three?” “Good sir, King Pasenadi is not even able to see the devas of the Thirty-Three. How then could he drive them away, or banish, them from that place?” “Even so, commander-in-chief, those <i>devas</i> that have been malevolent and are returners to a state of being such or so, are not even able to see those devas that have not been malevolent and are not returners to a state of being such or so. So how could they drive them away or banish them from that place?”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd19'></a>Then King Pasenadi spoke thus to the Lord: “What, revered sir, is this monk's name?” “His name is Ānanda, sire.” “Bliss indeed, indeed blissful! Revered sir, the venerable Ānanda speaks causally and it is in reference to cause, revered sir, that the venerable Ānanda speaks. <span class='note' hidden=''>bd: 'Bliss' is one possible meaning of 'Ānanda'.</span></p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd20'></a>But now, revered sir, is there a Brahmā?” “How can you, sire, speak thus: ‘Is there a Brahmā?’” “Be it that this Brahmā, revered sir, is a returner to the state of being such or so, or be it that he is not a returner to a state of being such or so?” “Sire, whatever Brahmā has been malevolent, is a returner to a state of being such or so; but whatever Brahmā has not been malevolent, is not a returner to a state of being such or so.”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd21'></a>Then a certain man spoke thus to King Pasenadi: “The brahman Sañjaya of the Ākāsa clan has arrived, sire.” Then King Pasenadi spoke thus to the brahman Sañjaya of the Ākāsa clan: “Now, who was it, brahman, that brought this subject of conversation into the palace?” “Viḍūḍabha, sire, the commander-in-chief.” “The commander-in-chief, Viḍūḍabha, speaks thus: ‘The brahman Sañjaya, sire, of the Ākāsa clan.’” Then a certain man spoke thus to King Pasenadi: “It is time for the vehicle, sire.”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd22'></a>Then King Pasenadi spoke thus to the Lord: “We, revered sir, questioned the Lord about omniscience; the Lord <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en314'></a>explained omniscience and because it was pleasing to us and approved, we are delighted. Revered sir, we questioned the Lord about the purity of the four castes; the Lord explained the purity of the four castes and because it was pleasing to us and approved, we are delighted. Revered sir, we questioned the Lord about the <i>devas;</i> the Lord explained the <i>devas</i> and because it was pleasing to us and approved, we are delighted. Revered sir, we questioned the Lord about Brahmā; the Lord explained about Brahmā and because it was pleasing to us and approved, we are delighted. And, revered sir, whatever it was we questioned the Lord about, that very thing the Lord explained and because it was pleasing to us and approved, we are delighted. And now, if it please you, revered sir, we are going; we are very busy and there is much to be done.” “You must do now, sire, that for which you deem it the right time.”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd23'></a>Then King Pasenadi of Kosala, delighted at what the Lord had said, having given thanks, rising from his seat, having greeted the Lord, departed keeping his right side towards him.</p>
