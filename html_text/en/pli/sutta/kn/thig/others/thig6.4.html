Garlands and sandal-wood bedecked,<br>
Covered all over with ornaments,<br>
Surrounded by my servants,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns146'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp146'></a><a class='ms' id='p_19Th2_204'></a><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv146'></a>Taking with us food and drink,<br>
Eatables of many kinds,<br>
Setting off from the house,<br>
To the forest grove we took it all.</p>

We turned our feet to home<br>
But on the way I saw and entered<br>
Near Saketa, a monastery.</p>

I drew near, bowed down to Him;<br>
Out of compassion the Seeing One<br>
Then taught me Dhamma there.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns149'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp149'></a><a class='ms' id='p_19Th2_207'></a><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv149'></a>Hearing the words of the Great Sage,<br>
I penetrated Truth:<br>
The Dhamma passionless,<br>
I touched the Dhamma of Deathlessness.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns150'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp150'></a><a class='ms' id='p_19Th2_208'></a><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv150'></a>When the True Dhamma had been known,<br>
I went forth to the homeless life;<br>
The three True Knowledges are attained,<br>
Not empty the Buddha's Teaching!</p>
