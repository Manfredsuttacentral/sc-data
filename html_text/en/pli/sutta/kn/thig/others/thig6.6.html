You foremost among all beings!<br>
You who have released me from pain,<br>
And so many other beings too.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns158'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp158'></a><a class='ms' id='p_19Th2_218'></a><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv158'></a>All suffering has been understood.<br>
The source of craving has withered.<br>
Cessation has been touched by me<br>
On the noble eight-fold path.</p>

And father, brother — grandmother too.<br>
Not understanding what was real,<br>
I flowed-on without finding [peace].</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns160'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp160'></a><a class='ms' id='p_19Th2_220'></a><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv160'></a>But now I've seen the Blessed One!<br>
This is my last compounded form.<br>
The on-flowing of birth has expired.<br>
There's no more re-becoming now.</p>

Putting forth effort, self controlled,<br>
Always with strong resolution<br>
—This is how to honor the Buddhas!</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns162'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp162'></a><a class='ms' id='p_19Th2_222'></a><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv162'></a>Surely for the good of so many<br>
Did Maya give birth to Gotama,<br>
Who bursts asunder the mass of pain<br>
Of those stricken by sickness and death.</p>
