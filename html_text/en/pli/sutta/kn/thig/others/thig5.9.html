With shaven head, covered in dust,<br>
Thinking of faults in the faultless,<br>
While in the faulty seeing no faults.</p>

I went to Mount Vulture Peak<br>
And saw the stainless Buddha<br>
By the Order of Bhikkhus revered.</p>

Humbly, I bowed down on my knees.<br>
"Come, Bhadda," He said to me:<br>
And thus was I ordained.</p>

In Anga, Magadha and Vajji,<br>
In Kasi and Kosala, too,<br>
Living on the alms of the land.</p>

May many merits accrue to him!<br>
Who gave a robe to Bhadda for<br>
Free of all ties is she.</p>
