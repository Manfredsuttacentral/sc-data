— the color of bees —<br>
& curled at the tips;<br>
with age, it looked like coarse hemp.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
doesn't change.</p>

filled with flowers:<br>
With age it smelled musty,<br>
like animal fur.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
doesn't change.</p>

made splendid, the tips elaborate<br>
with comb & pin.<br>
With age, it grew thin<br>
& bare here & there.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
doesn't change.</p>

it was splendid, ornamented with braids.<br>
Now, with age,<br>
that head has gone bald.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
doesn't change.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns256'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp256'></a><a class='ms' id='p_19Th2_334'></a><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv256'></a>Curved, as if well-drawn by an artist,<br>
my brows were once splendid.<br>
With age, they droop down in folds.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
doesn't change.</p>

my eyes:<br>
With age, they're no longer splendid.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
doesn't change.</p>

was splendid in the prime of my youth.<br>
With age, it's like a long pepper.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
doesn't change.</p>

my teeth were once splendid.<br>
With age, they're broken & yellowed.<br>

doesn't change.</p>

flitting through deep forest thickets:<br>
sweet was the tone of my voice.<br>
With age, it cracks here & there.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
doesn't change.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='11'></a><a class='vns' id='vns262'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp262'></a><a class='ms' id='p_19Th2_340'></a><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv262'></a>Smooth — like a conch shell well-polished —<br>
my neck was once splendid.<br>
With age, it's broken down, bent.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
doesn't change.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='12'></a><a class='vns' id='vns263'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp263'></a><a class='pts' id='pts149'></a><a class='ms' id='p_19Th2_341'></a><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv263'></a>Like rounded door-bars — both of them —<br>
my arms were once splendid.<br>
With age, they're like dried up patali trees.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
doesn't change.</p>

both my breasts were once splendid.<br>
In the drought of old age, they dangle<br>
like empty old water bags.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
doesn't change.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='15'></a><a class='vns' id='vns266'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp266'></a><a class='ms' id='p_19Th2_344'></a><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv266'></a>Like a sheet of gold, well-burnished,<br>
my body was splendid.<br>
Now it's covered with very fine wrinkles.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
doesn't change.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='16'></a><a class='vns' id='vns267'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp267'></a><a class='ms' id='p_19Th2_345'></a><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv267'></a>Smooth in their lines, like an elephant's trunk,<br>
both my thighs were once splendid.<br>
With age, they're like knotted bamboo.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
doesn't change.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='17'></a><a class='vns' id='vns268'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp268'></a><a class='ms' id='p_19Th2_346'></a><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv268'></a>Adorned with gold & delicate anklets,<br>
my calves were once splendid.<br>
With age, they're like sesame sticks.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
doesn't change.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='18'></a><a class='vns' id='vns269'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp269'></a><a class='ms' id='p_19Th2_347'></a><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv269'></a>As if they were stuffed with soft cotton,<br>
both my feet were once splendid.<br>
With age, they're shriveled & cracked.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
doesn't change.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='19'></a><a class='vns' id='vns270'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp270'></a><a class='pts' id='pts150'></a><a class='ms' id='p_19Th2_348'></a><a class='msdiv' id='msdiv270'></a>Such was this physical heap,<br>
now:<br>
A house with its plaster all fallen off.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
doesn't change.</p>
