<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>At one time the Radiant one was dwelling at Jeta’s Grove in the park of Anāthapiṇḍika near Sāvatthī.

Standing there that deva addressed the Radiant One with a verse:</p>

<p><a class='sc' id='sc27'></a><a class='vns' id='vns115'></a>The one who’s wise well knows the way<br>
within this world to disaster’s woe;<br>
and then that Noble, insight pure,<br>
to a blessed state one such does go.</p>
