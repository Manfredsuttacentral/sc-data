<h1>4.7. To Tissametteyya on the Disadvantages of Sex</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><a class='vns' id='vns821'></a><span class='speaker'>Tissa</span><br>
Attached to sexual intercourse:<br>
Sir, tell its disadvantages,<br>
having heard your Teaching then,<br>
secluded we will train ourselves.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns822'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Attached to sexual intercourse,<br>
forgetful of the Teaching then,<br>
wrong things that person practices,<br>
and does what is not Noble.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns823'></a>Who formerly fared on alone<br>
but now in sex indulges,<br>
“Low” they say’s that common worldly one,<br>
like vehicle swerving off the track.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns824'></a>That one who had renown and fame—<br>
that, for sure, diminishes,<br>
having seen this, train yourself,<br>
renouncing sexual intercourse.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns825'></a>Overcome by (lustful) thoughts,<br>
that one broods as a beggar does,<br>
and hearing reproach of others, then<br>
such a person is depressed.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns826'></a>For yourself creating “arms”<br>
of others reprimanding words,<br>
so with great entanglement<br>
sinks down into untruthfulness.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a><a class='vns' id='vns827'></a>Well-known as “one who’s wise”<br>
when vowing to the single life,<br>
but later then engaged in sex<br>
will be “a fool defiled”.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a><a class='vns' id='vns828'></a>The disadvantage having known,<br>
the sage, at start and afterwards,<br>
should stablish fast the single life,<br>
having no recourse to sex.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9'></a><a class='vns' id='vns829'></a>So train yourself in solitude,<br>
for that’s the life of Noble Ones,<br>
but not conceive oneself as “best”—<br>
them near indeed to Nirvāṇa.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc10'></a><a class='vns' id='vns830'></a>The sage who’s rid of sense-desires,<br>
who to them’s indifferent,<br>
who’s crossed the flood, is envied then,<br>
by those enmeshed with pleasures of sense.</p>
