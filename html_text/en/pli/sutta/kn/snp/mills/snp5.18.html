<h1>5.18. Epilogue: In Praise of the Way to the Beyond</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>The Radiant One said this while he stayed among the Magadhese at the Pāsānika Shrine. There he was asked, then he questioned, the sixteen brahmin pupils, answering their questions. If one should understand the meaning of even one question, and then practise the Dharma according to the Dharma, then one would go to the farther shore beyond ageing and death. As this Dharma leads to the farther shore it is known as the Teaching leading to the Farther Shore (<i>pārāyana</i>).</p>

the brahmin who’s called Posāla,<br>
Mogharāja the very wise<br>
and Piṅgiya the seer so great—</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1133'></a>All these approached the perfect Seer,<br>
the Buddha who practised perfectly,<br>
to question him on subtle points,<br>

<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1134'></a>Having been questioned the Buddha replied<br>
with Dharma according to how it really is.<br>
In answering their questions the Sage<br>

This path goes to the far shore, which is why<br>
It’s called the “Way to the Far Shore”.</p>
