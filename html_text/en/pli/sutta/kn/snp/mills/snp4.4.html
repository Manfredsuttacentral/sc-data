<h1>4.4. The Eight on Purity</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><a class='vns' id='vns795'></a>“A pure one I see”, free completely from disease,<br>
so by “seeing” such (it is said) one attains to purity.<br>
Convinced about this and holding it highest<br>
that one relies on this knowledge<br>
while contemplating purity.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns796'></a>But if a person by seeings’ purified<br>
or if through such knowledge could leave <i>dukkha</i> aside<br>
then one with assets still by another could be purified:<br>
this view betrays one who speaks in this way.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns797'></a>The Brahmin says not that “by another, one is purified”—<br>
not by sights or by sounds, rites and vows and what’s sensed.<br>
Such person’s not stuck upon merit or evil,<br>
with selfishness renounced, constructing nothing here.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns798'></a>Former (things) let go, then to other (things) attached,<br>
following craving, their bondage, they do not overcross,<br>
so they (continue) with grasping and discarding,<br>
as monkey letting go a branch to seize upon another.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns799'></a>A person undertaking (holy) vows goes high and low—<br>
they waver, fettered by conditional perceptions.<br>
But one who has learnt well and the Dharma penetrated<br>
goes not up and down—<br>
that one of wisdom profound.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns800'></a>Within all the dharmas whether seen or they’re heard,<br>
or otherwise sensed, this one fights not at all,<br>
that one who sees them nakedly while faring to the end,<br>
by whom in the world could he be described?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a><a class='vns' id='vns801'></a>They neither form views, show nothing’s preferred,<br>
nor do they claim a purity supreme,<br>
having loosened craving’s knot with which they were bound,<br>
no longer they have longing for what’s in the world.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a><a class='vns' id='vns802'></a>Having Known, having Seen, there’s nothing to be grasped<br>
by a Brahmin gone beyond all limitations,<br>
neither lustful with lusts nor to lustlessness attached—<br>
in this there is nothing that’s grasped as the highest.</p>
