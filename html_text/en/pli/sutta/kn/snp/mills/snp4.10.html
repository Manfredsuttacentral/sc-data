<h1>4.10. “Before Breaking-up”: a Muni’s Qualities</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><a class='vns' id='vns855'></a><span class='speaker'>Question</span><br>
Please Gotama, do you speak to me<br>
upon the person perfected:<br>
how’s their insight and their conduct<br>
so that they can be called “Peaceful One”?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns856'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
One who is craving-free<br>
before the body’s breaking-up,<br>
not dependent on the past<br>
in the present is prepared,<br>
(and in future) has nought preferred,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns857'></a>gone anger and gone fear as well,<br>
gone boasting, gone remorse,<br>
wise-speaker with no arrogance,<br>
a Sage restrained in speech,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns858'></a>no hopes for what’s to come,<br>
no mourning for the past,<br>
not led astray by views,<br>
the singled seer “mid senses” touch</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns859'></a>one not concealing, not deceitful,<br>
not hankering and neither mean,<br>
not stuck-up, nor contemptuous,<br>
and not to slander given,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns860'></a>to pleasures not addicted<br>
and not to pride inclined,<br>
gentle, ready witted, not<br>
credulous and not attached,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a><a class='vns' id='vns861'></a>training not in hope of gain,<br>
nor disturbed by getting none,<br>
by cravings unobstructed,<br>
hankering not for tastes,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a><a class='vns' id='vns862'></a>ever mindful and equanimous,<br>
so, who as “equal” thinks not of themselves,<br>
nor as better nor as worse,<br>
has no of inflation any sense.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9'></a><a class='vns' id='vns863'></a>And for whom there’s no “dependence”,<br>
not dependent, Dharma having known,<br>
for such exists no craving for<br>
existence, non-existence.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc10'></a><a class='vns' id='vns864'></a>That one I call the Peaceful,<br>
who no sensual pleasures seeks;<br>
who therefore has no ties,<br>
crossed entanglement.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc11'></a><a class='vns' id='vns865'></a>He does not bring up any sons,<br>
and has no fields or lands;<br>
for him there is nothing at all<br>
that is taken up or put down</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc12'></a><a class='vns' id='vns866'></a>on account of which, the people<br>
with monks and Brahmins might accuse.<br>
That one is undisturbed,<br>
and by such words unmoved,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc13'></a><a class='vns' id='vns867'></a>gone greediness and never mean,<br>
not speaking of themselves as “high”<br>
not “equal”, nor “inferior”<br>
so the unfittable does not fit,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc14'></a><a class='vns' id='vns868'></a>for whom is nothing owned in the world<br>
and having nothing does not grieve,<br>
who ’mong Dharmas ventures not<br>
is truly called a Peaceful One!</p>
