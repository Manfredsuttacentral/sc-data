<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><a class='vns' id='vns885'></a><span class='speaker'>Question</span><br>
Each attached to their own views,<br>
They dispute, and the experts say,<br>
“Whoever knows this understands the Dhamma,<br>
Whoever rejects it is imprefect.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns886'></a>Arguing like this, they disagree, saying<br>
“My opponent is a fool, and is no expert”<br>
Which of these doctrines is the truth,<br>
Since all of them say they are experts?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns887'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
If by not accepting another’s teaching<br>
One became a fool of debased wisdom<br>
Then, honestly, all are fools of debased wisdom,<br>
Since all are attached to views.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns888'></a>But if people are washed by their own views,<br>
With pure wisdom, experts, thoughtful,<br>
Then none of them has debased wisdom,<br>
For their views are perfect.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns889'></a>I don’t say, “This is how it is”,<br>
Like the fools who oppose each other.<br>
Each of them makes out that their view is the truth,<br>
So they treat their opponent as a fool.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns890'></a><span class='speaker'>Question</span><br>
What some say is the truth,<br>
Others say is false.<br>
So they argue, disagreeing;<br>
Why don’t the ascetics teach one truth?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a><a class='vns' id='vns891'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Indeed the truth is one, there’s not another,<br>
about this the One who Knows<br>
does not dispute with another,<br>
but the <i>Samaṇas</i> proclaim their varied “truths”<br>
and so they speak not in the same way.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a><a class='vns' id='vns892'></a>Why do they speak such varied truths,<br>
these so-called experts disputatious—<br>
Are there really many and various truths<br>
Or do they just rehearse their logic?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9'></a><a class='vns' id='vns893'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Indeed, there are not many and varied truths<br>
differing from perception of the ever-true in the world;<br>
but they work upon their views with logic:<br>
“Truth! Falsehood!” So they speak in dualities.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc10'></a><a class='vns' id='vns894'></a>Based on what is seen, heard,<br>
On precepts and vows, or what is cognized,<br>
They look down on others.<br>
Convinced of their own theories,<br>
pleased with themselves,<br>
They say, “My opponent is a fool, no expert.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc11'></a><a class='vns' id='vns895'></a>They consider themselves expert for the same reasons<br>
That they despise their opponent as a fool.<br>
Calling themselves experts, they despise the other,<br>
Yet they speak the very same way.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc12'></a><a class='vns' id='vns896'></a>And since perfected in some extreme view,<br>
puffed with pride and maddened by conceit,<br>
he anoints himself as though the master-mind,<br>
likewise thinking his view’s perfected too.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc13'></a><a class='vns' id='vns897'></a>If their opponent says they are deficient,<br>
They too are of deficient understanding.<br>
But if they are wise and knowledgeable,<br>
Then there are no fools among the ascetics.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc14'></a><a class='vns' id='vns898'></a>“Anyone who teaches a doctrine other than this,<br>
Has fallen short of purity and perfection.”<br>
This is what followers of other paths say,<br>
Passionately defending their very different views.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc15'></a><a class='vns' id='vns899'></a>“Here alone is purity,” so they say,<br>
“There is no purity in the teachings of others.”<br>
This is what followers of other paths strongly assert,<br>
Each entrenched in their own different path.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc16'></a><a class='vns' id='vns900'></a>Strongly asserting their own path,<br>
What opponent would they take to be a fool?<br>
They would only bring trouble on themselves<br>
By calling an opponent a fool of impure teachings.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc17'></a><a class='vns' id='vns901'></a>Convinced of their own theories,<br>
Comparing others to oneself,<br>
They get into more disputes with the world.<br>
But by leaving behind all theories,<br>
They don’t have any problems with the world.</p>
