<h1>3.1. The Leaving Home of Gotama</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><a class='vns' id='vns408'></a><span class='speaker'>Narrator</span><br>
Now I’ll tell of the Leaving Home,<br>
how he, the mighty seer, went forth,<br>
how he was questioned and described<br>
the reason for his Leaving Home.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns409'></a>The crowded life lived in a house<br>
exhales an atmosphere of dust:<br>
but leaving home is open wide—<br>
seeing this, he chose Leaving Home.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns410'></a>By doing so did he reject<br>
all bodily evil acts,<br>
rejected too, wrong ways of speech,<br>
his livelihood he purified.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns411'></a>He went to Rājagaha town,<br>
hill-guarded fort of Magadhans;<br>
there he, the Buddha, walked for alms,<br>
with many a mark of excellence.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns412'></a>King Bimbisāra from within<br>
his palace saw him passing by,<br>
and when he saw such excellence<br>
in all his marks,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns413'></a><span class='speaker'>Bimbisāra</span><br>
“Look, sirs”, he said,<br>
How stately is that man, handsome,<br>
how pure, how perfect is his gait;<br>
with eyes downcast, mindful, he looks<br>
only a plough-yoke’s length ahead.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a><a class='vns' id='vns414'></a>He’s surely not of humble birth!<br>
Send forth royal messengers at once<br>
upon the path the bhikkhu takes.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a><a class='vns' id='vns415'></a><span class='speaker'>Messenger</span><br>
The messengers were sent at once<br>
and followed closely in his wake:<br>
“Now which way will the bhikkhu go?<br>
Where has he chosen his abode?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9'></a><a class='vns' id='vns416'></a>He wanders on from house to house<br>
guarding sense-doors with real restraint.<br>
Fully aware and mindfully,<br>
his alms bowl soon was full.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc10'></a><a class='vns' id='vns417'></a>His almsround is now done. The Sage<br>
is setting out and leaving town,<br>
taking the road to Paṇḍava—<br>
he must be living on its hill.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc11'></a><a class='vns' id='vns418'></a><span class='speaker'>Narrator</span><br>
Now when he came to his abode<br>
the messengers went up to him;<br>
though one of them turned back again<br>
to give the King reply:</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc12'></a><a class='vns' id='vns419'></a><span class='speaker'>Messenger</span><br>
The bhikkhu, sire, is like a lion,<br>
or like a tiger, like a bull<br>
and seated in a mountain-cave<br>
on the eastern slope of Paṇḍava!</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc13'></a><a class='vns' id='vns420'></a><span class='speaker'>Narrator</span><br>
The Warrior hears the runner’s tale,<br>
then summoning up a coach of state,<br>
he drove in haste from out the town,<br>
out to the hill of Paṇḍava.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc14'></a><a class='vns' id='vns421'></a>He drove as far as he could go,<br>
and then descended from the coach;<br>
the little distance that remained,<br>
he went on foot, drew near the Sage.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc15'></a><a class='vns' id='vns422'></a>The King sat down, and he exchanged<br>
greetings, and asked about his health.<br>
When this exchange of courtesy was done,<br>
the king then spoke to him these words:</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc16'></a><a class='vns' id='vns423'></a><span class='speaker'>Bimbisāra</span><br>
You are indeed quite young,<br>
a youth, a man in life’s first phase,<br>
you have the good looks of a man<br>
of high-born warrior-noble stock,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc17'></a><a class='vns' id='vns424'></a>one ﬁt to grace a first-rate force,<br>
to lead the troops of elephants,<br>
wealth can I give you to enjoy;<br>
please tell me of your birth.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc18'></a><a class='vns' id='vns425'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Straight over there, O king,<br>
the Himalayas can be seen,<br>
there, with wealth and energy,<br>
living among the Kosalans</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc19'></a><a class='vns' id='vns426'></a>are the Ādicca of solar race,<br>
in that, the clan of Sakyas.<br>
From that family I’ve left home<br>
not desiring pleasures of sense.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc20'></a><a class='vns' id='vns427'></a>Having seen dangers in sense-desires,<br>
renunciation seen as secure,<br>
I shall go on to strive<br>
for there does my mind delight</p>
