<h1>5.14. Udaya’s Questions</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1112'></a><span class='speaker'>Udaya</span><br>
To the contemplative seated free of dust,<br>
done what should be done, with inﬂows none,<br>
to the one beyond all dharmas gone,<br>
to him with a question have I come:<br>
Please say by shattering ignorance<br>
how Final Knowledge’s free.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1113'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Let go desires for pleasures of sense,<br>
with all bad-mindedness as well,<br>
sloth dispel and check remorse,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1114'></a>poised mindfulness completely pure,<br>
forerun by Dharma-distinguishing:<br>
I say by shattering ignorance,<br>
there’s Final Knowledge free.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1115'></a><span class='speaker'>Udaya</span><br>
What’s the fetter of the world?<br>
and what the world’s wandering?<br>
By abandonment of what<br>
is it Nirvāṇa named?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1116'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Enjoyment: the fetter of the world,<br>
while thinking, the world’s wandering,<br>
the letting-go of craving—<br>
it’s Nirvāṇa named.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1117'></a><span class='speaker'>Udaya</span><br>
How is consciousness broken up<br>
in one who practises mindfully?<br>
To the Lord we come with this question,<br>
we wish to hear your words.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1118'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Feeling both within, without—<br>
in that do not delight,<br>
thus consciousness is broken up<br>
in one who practises mindfully.</p>
