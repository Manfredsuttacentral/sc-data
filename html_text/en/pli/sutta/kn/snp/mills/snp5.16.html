<h1>5.16. Mogharāja’s Question</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1123'></a><span class='speaker'>Mogharāja</span><br>
The Sakyan I’ve requested twice<br>
but the Seer has not replied;<br>
I have heard tell that questioned thrice,<br>
a Sage divine explains.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1124'></a>I do not understand the view<br>
of the renowned Gotama<br>
upon this world, the other world,<br>
on Brahma’s realm, the deva’s world.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1125'></a>So to the One of vision supreme,<br>
with this query have I come:<br>
how should one regard the world<br>
that the Death-king sees one not?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1126'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Be ever mindful, Mogharāja,<br>
and as empty, view the world,<br>
with view of self pulled up,<br>
and thus crossed over death—<br>
who sees the world like this<br>
the King of Death sees not.</p>
