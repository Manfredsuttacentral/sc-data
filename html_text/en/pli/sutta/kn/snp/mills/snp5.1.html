A brahmin who’d mastered all mantras,<br>
Desiring the state of no-thingness,<br>
From Kosalans’ fair city he left then<br>
Towards the southern parts.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns984'></a>By Godhāvarī river he sojourned<br>
In Assaka’s realm near Alaka’s border,<br>
Surviving on gleanings and fruit.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns985'></a>Close by to him a village large,<br>
With revenue derived from there,<br>
Great the sacrifice he performed.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns986'></a>With ritual offerings made<br>
For the sacrifice, he returned<br>
To his hermitage again,<br>
And there another brahmin came.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns987'></a>Footsore and thirsty, he,<br>
with teeth unclean, dust-covered head,<br>
then approached him begging for<br>
at least five hundred coins.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns988'></a>Having seen him, Bāvarī<br>
invited him to take a seat<br>
and asked about his comfort, health—<br>
then to the stranger spoke these words:</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a><a class='vns' id='vns989'></a><span class='speaker'>Bāvarī</span><br>
Whatever was given for me to give,<br>
All this I’ve given away,<br>
So brahmin please forgive me,<br>
I’ve not five hundred coins.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a><a class='vns' id='vns990'></a><span class='speaker'>Brahmin</span><br>
If your honour will not give<br>
To me who begs from him,<br>
Then let your head be split apart<br>
In seven days from now.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9'></a><a class='vns' id='vns991'></a><span class='speaker'>Narrator</span><br>
Having done preparatory rites<br>
That charlatan a fearful curse pronounced,<br>
So that having heard his words<br>
“one-with-<i>dukkha</i>” did Bāvarī become.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc10'></a><a class='vns' id='vns992'></a>He took no food and withered up,<br>
afflicted with the dart of grief;<br>
and then with mind of such a kind,<br>
his heart enjoyed no <i>jhāna</i>.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc11'></a><a class='vns' id='vns993'></a>Seeing him suffering, terrified,<br>
a deva there who wished his good,<br>
on drawing near to Bāvarī,<br>
to him she spoke these words:</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc12'></a><a class='vns' id='vns994'></a><span class='speaker'>Devī</span><br>
He doesn’t know about the head,<br>
that charlatan desiring wealth;<br>
of heads, and splitting heads apart,<br>
in him no knowing’s found.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc13'></a><a class='vns' id='vns995'></a><span class='speaker'>Bāvarī</span><br>
If my lady knows of this,<br>
when asked, please tell me too;<br>
let me hear your words on this,<br>
on heads and splitting heads apart.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc14'></a><a class='vns' id='vns996'></a><span class='speaker'>Devī</span><br>
I do not know about this thing,<br>
in me no knowing’s found,<br>
on heads and splitting heads apart<br>
but by Victors it has been Seen.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc15'></a><a class='vns' id='vns997'></a><span class='speaker'>Bāvarī</span><br>
Who, then knows about this thing?<br>
Who on this sphere of earth?<br>
On heads and splitting heads apart,<br>
O deva, tell me this.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc16'></a><a class='vns' id='vns998'></a><span class='speaker'>Devī</span><br>
From out of Kapilavatthu town<br>
came lately, Leader of the world,<br>
a Sakyan son bringing light,<br>
a scion of Okkāka king.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc17'></a><a class='vns' id='vns999'></a>He is indeed a Wakened One<br>
all dharmas gone across,<br>
all straightly-knowing’s power won,<br>
in all dharmas, Seer,<br>
to exhaustion of all dharmas won,<br>
freed by all assets’ wearing out—</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc18'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1000'></a>One Awakened, lord of the world,<br>
the Seer who teaches Dharma,<br>
go to him and then enquire—<br>
that matter he’ll explain.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc19'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1001'></a><span class='speaker'>Narrator</span><br>
On hearing “Sambuddha”—that word,<br>
Bāvarī was overjoyed,<br>
and grief diminished too,<br>
while rapture then arose in him.<br>
Glad at heart, overjoyed, in awe,<br>
spoke Bāvarī to that devatā:</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc20'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1002'></a><span class='speaker'>Bāvarī</span><br>
In which village, in which town,<br>
in which state is the world’s lord found?<br>
Where should we go to honour him,<br>
the All-awakened, best of men?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc21'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1003'></a><span class='speaker'>Devī</span><br>
In Kosala’s kingdom he dwells,<br>
the greatly wise truly of Knowledge profound,<br>
of Sakyas the scion, burdenless, from inﬂows free,<br>
the eminent among men knows splitting the head.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc22'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1004'></a><span class='speaker'>Narrator</span><br>
Addressing then his brahmin pupils,<br>
those who had mastered the mantras:</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc23'></a><span class='speaker'>Bāvarī</span><br>
Come here, young brahmins, listen well<br>
for I shall speak to you.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc24'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1005'></a>Whose rare appearance in the world<br>
is hard then to experience,<br>
has appeared for us today,<br>
acclaimed as All-awakened One,<br>
quickly now go to Sāvatthī,<br>
to see this Best of men.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc25'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1006'></a><span class='speaker'>Pupils</span><br>
How, O brahmin, shall we know<br>
on seeing him that he’s Awake?<br>
Tell us, who are so ignorant,<br>
that him we’ll recognize?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc26'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1007'></a><span class='speaker'>Bāvarī</span><br>
In mantra-hymns come down to us,<br>
the signs of Superman—<br>
two and thirty there complete,<br>
in order are described.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc27'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1008'></a>Upon whose body these appear—<br>
these signs of the Superman—<br>
two possibilities are there for birth,<br>
a third bourn is not found:</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc28'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1009'></a>So should he choose the household life,<br>
this world he’ll conquer weaponless,<br>
non-violently, without a sword,<br>
by Dharma rule it righteously.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc29'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1010'></a>But if he go forth from home<br>
to the state of homelessness,<br>
he’ll be Awake, removed the veils,<br>
one of worth, the unexcelled.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc30'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1011'></a>Question in your mind alone<br>
my birth, my caste, how I appear,<br>
my mantras, pupils and so on,<br>
with heads and splitting heads apart.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc31'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1012'></a>If he’s indeed the One Awake,<br>
who, lacking obscurations, Sees;<br>
to Questions asked in mind alone,<br>
he will reply with words.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc32'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1013'></a><span class='speaker'>Narrator</span><br>
The voice of Bāvarī they heard,<br>
those brahmin pupils—all sixteen:<br>
Ajita, Tissamettayya,<br>
Puṇṇaka, then there’s Mettagu,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc33'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1014'></a>Dhotaka, Upasīva then<br>
Nanda, also Hemaka,<br>
Todeyya, Kappa—just those two,<br>
Jātukaṇṇa the learned one,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc34'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1015'></a>Bhadrāvudha, Udaya and<br>
as well the brahmin Posala,<br>
Moghāraja the very wise<br>
and Piṅgiya the greatest sage—</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc35'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1016'></a>All of them with their pupils’ groups<br>
in all the world they’re famed—<br>
enjoyers of <i>jhāna</i>, meditators Wise,<br>
patterned by past good karmas made.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc36'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1017'></a>Having bowed down to Bāvarī<br>
and circumambulated him,<br>
then in deer-skins clad, with dreadlocks all,<br>
they headed for the north:</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc37'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1018'></a>From Patiṭṭhāna in Aḷaka’s land,<br>
then to the city, Māhissati,<br>
from there to Ujjeni and Gonaddha,<br>
to Vedisa and to Vana town,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc38'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1019'></a>Next to Kosambi and Sāketa,<br>
and Sāvatthī of cities best<br>
on to Setavya, Kapilavatthu,<br>
Kusināra and surrounding lands,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc39'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1020'></a>To Pāvā and to Bhoga town,<br>
to the Māgadhans’ city of Vesāli,<br>
to the rocky Pāsāṇaka Shrine—<br>
delightful, mind-delighting place.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc40'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1021'></a>As a person thirsty for water,<br>
or merchant for proﬁt great,<br>
or a sunburnt person seeks for shade,<br>
so they hastily climbed the Rock.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc41'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1022'></a>The Lord on that occasion was<br>
in honour seated with the <i>bhikkhu-Saṅgha</i>,<br>
teaching Dharma to all the monks,<br>
as lion roaring in the jungly woods.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc42'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1023'></a>Ajita saw then the Sambuddha<br>
as the sun’s brilliance devoid of rays,<br>
or as the moon completely full,<br>
arrived at its fifteenth day.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc43'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1024'></a>Then standing to one side he saw<br>
the set of signs complete<br>
upon the Buddha’s body, so<br>
joyful, in his mind he asked:</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc44'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1025'></a><span class='speaker'>Ajita</span><br>
Speak now about my Master’s age,<br>
tell of his clan and body-marks,<br>
say how far he’s mastered the mantras<br>
and how many the brahmins he instructs.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc45'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1026'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
His age is a hundred and twenty years,<br>
by clan he is a Bāvarī,<br>
upon his body appear three signs,<br>
Three Vedas he has mastered all.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc46'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1027'></a>In lore of signs and legends in tradition—<br>
in the glossaries and the ritual treatises—<br>
in his own Dharma to perfection he’s arrived,<br>
and five hundred students he instructs.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc47'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1028'></a><span class='speaker'>Ajita</span><br>
O highest of men, with craving cut,<br>
describe in detail all the signs<br>
upon the body of Bāvarī,<br>
so there may be no doubt in us.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc48'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1029'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Cover his face with his tongue he can,<br>
hair grows between his brows,<br>
ensheathed is the cloth-concealed:<br>
Know this, O brahmin youth.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc49'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1030'></a><span class='speaker'>Narrator</span><br>
Now none there heard the questions asked,<br>
but all the answers heard;<br>
then the people, overjoyed,<br>
with lotussed hands they thought:</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc50'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1031'></a>What deva indeed, whether Brahma<br>
or Indra or Sujampati—<br>
these questions asked in mind,<br>
to whom are they addressed?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc51'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1032'></a><span class='speaker'>Ajita</span><br>
Bāvarī has questioned you<br>
on heads and splitting heads apart.<br>
O Lord, do you explain this,<br>
dispel our doubt, O Sage.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc52'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1033'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Know ignorance as “head”,<br>
gnosis as that which “splits the head”,<br>
with mindfulness, meditation, faith<br>
by determination, effort too.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc53'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1034'></a><span class='speaker'>Narrator</span><br>
Then the young brahmin overawed,<br>
with great emotion overcome,<br>
(respectfully) with his deerskin (cloak)<br>
over one shoulder (placed),<br>
put his head at (the Buddha’s) feet.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc54'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1035'></a><span class='speaker'>Ajita</span><br>
Sir, the brahmin Bāvarī,<br>
with all his pupils too,<br>
overjoyed, glad-minded,<br>
to the great Seer’s feet bowed down.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc55'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1036'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
May all be well with Bāvarī,<br>
with his brahmin pupils too,<br>
and you as well be happy,<br>
live long O brahmin youth!</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc56'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1037'></a>Bāvarī, yourself as well<br>
and all the rest have many doubts,<br>
ask now whatever’s in your minds—<br>
you have the opportunity.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc57'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1038'></a>So permitted by the All-awake,<br>
Ajita sat, and with lotussed hands,<br>
asked the initial question,<br>
addressed to the Tathāgata.</p>
