<h1>2.11. Teaching Rāhula</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><a class='vns' id='vns338'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
From living together constantly,<br>
the Teacher you don’t scorn?<br>
Torch-bearer to humanity,<br>
is he by you revered?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns339'></a><span class='speaker'>Rāhula</span><br>
From living together constantly,<br>
the Teacher I scorn not.<br>
Torch-bearer to humanity<br>
is by me revered.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns340'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Having let go five sense-desires,<br>
and forms that are dear, delighting mind,<br>
with faith renounce the household life,<br>
be one who <i>dukkha</i> ends.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns341'></a>Keep company with noble friends,<br>
dwell in a lonely practice-place,<br>
secluded, having little noise,<br>
with food be moderate.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns342'></a>Robes as well as food from alms,<br>
with shelter, also remedies—<br>
for these things no craving form,<br>
so turn not to the world again.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns343'></a>By Pāṭimokkha stay restrained<br>
and by the five sense faculties,<br>
practise bodily mindfulness<br>
to be dispassionate.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a><a class='vns' id='vns344'></a>Avoid those objects beautiful,<br>
which may be linked with lust,<br>
on the unlovely, one-pointed,<br>
well-concentrated, grow the mind.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a><a class='vns' id='vns345'></a>Develop then the signless state,<br>
with tendency to pride let go—<br>
by fully understanding it,<br>
truly as peaceful you will fare.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9'></a>In this way the Radiant One with these verses frequently exhorted the venerable Rāhula.</p>
