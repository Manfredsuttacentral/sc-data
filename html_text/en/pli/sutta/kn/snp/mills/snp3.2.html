<h1>3.2. The Striving of Gotama</h1>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><a class='vns' id='vns428'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
As I strove to subdue myself<br>
beside the broad Nerañjarā,<br>
absorbed unflinchingly to gain<br>
the surcease of bondage here,<br>
Namucī came and spoke to me<br>
with words all garbed in pity thus:</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns429'></a><span class='speaker'>Māra</span><br>
O you are thin and you are pale,<br>
and you are in death’s presence too:</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns430'></a>a thousand parts are pledged to death<br>
but life still holds one part of you.<br>
Live, sir! Life’s the better way;<br>
you may gain merit if you live,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns431'></a>come live the life of purity, pour<br>
libations on the holy fires<br>
and thus a world of merit gain.<br>
What can you do by struggling now?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns432'></a>The path of struggling too is rough,<br>
and difficult and hard to bear.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><span class='speaker'>Narrator</span><br>
Now Māra, as he spoke these lines<br>
drew near until he stood close by.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a><a class='vns' id='vns433'></a>The Blessed One replied to him<br>
as he stood thus:</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
O Evil One,<br>
O Cousin of the Negligent,<br>
you have come here for your own ends.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9'></a><a class='vns' id='vns434'></a>Now, merit I need not at all.<br>
Let Māra talk of merit then,<br>
to those that stand in need of it.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc10'></a><a class='vns' id='vns435'></a>For I have faith and energy,<br>
and I have understanding, too.<br>
So while I thus subdue myself,<br>
why do you speak to me of life?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc11'></a><a class='vns' id='vns436'></a>There is this wind that blows, can dry<br>
even the rivers’ running streams;<br>
so while I thus subdue myself,<br>
why should it not dry up my blood?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc12'></a><a class='vns' id='vns437'></a>And, as the blood dries up, then bile<br>
and phlegm run dry, the wasting flesh<br>
becalms the mind: I shall have more<br>
of mindfulness and wisdom too,<br>
I shall have greater concentration.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc13'></a><a class='vns' id='vns438'></a>For living thus I come to know<br>
the limits to which feeling goes.<br>
My mind looks not to sense-desires:<br>
Now see a being’s purity.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc14'></a><a class='vns' id='vns439'></a>Your squadron’s first is Sense-desires<br>
your second’s Sexual Discontent,<br>
Hunger and Thirst compose the third,<br>
and Craving is the fourth in rank,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc15'></a><a class='vns' id='vns440'></a>the fifth is Sloth and Accidy,<br>
while Fear is called the sixth in line,<br>
Sceptical doubt is seventh, the eighth<br>
is Sliminess, Hardheartedness;</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc16'></a><a class='vns' id='vns441'></a>Gain with Honour, Praise besides,<br>
and ill-won Notoriety,<br>
Self-praise and Denigrating others—</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc17'></a><a class='vns' id='vns442'></a>These are your squadrons, Namucī,<br>
the Black One’s fighting troops.<br>
None but the brave will conquer them<br>
to gain bliss by the victory.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc18'></a><a class='vns' id='vns443'></a>As though I’m weaving <i>muñja</i>-grass,<br>
proclaiming no retreat: shame upon life<br>
defeated here—better to die in battle now<br>
than choose to live on in defeat.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc19'></a><a class='vns' id='vns444'></a>Ascetics and brahmins there are found<br>
that have surrendered here, and they<br>
are seen no more: they do not know<br>
the paths the pilgrim travels by.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc20'></a><a class='vns' id='vns445'></a>So, seeing Māra’s squadrons now<br>
arrayed all round, with elephants,<br>
I sally forth to fight, that I<br>
may not be driven from my post.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc21'></a><a class='vns' id='vns446'></a>Your serried squadrons, which the world<br>
with all its gods cannot defeat,<br>
Now I’ll break with wisdom sharp,<br>
as with a stone a raw clay pot.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc22'></a><a class='vns' id='vns447'></a>With all mind’s thoughts within the range,<br>
with well-established mindfulness,<br>
I’ll travel on from state to state<br>
many disciples leading out.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc23'></a><a class='vns' id='vns448'></a>They, both diligent and resolute<br>
carry on my <i>Sāsana</i>,<br>
and though you like it not, they’ll go<br>
to where they do not grieve.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc24'></a><a class='vns' id='vns449'></a><span class='speaker'>Māra</span><br>
Though step by step for seven years<br>
I’ve followed on the Blessed One,<br>
the Fully Enlightened One, possessed<br>
of mindfulness, he gave to me no chance.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc25'></a><a class='vns' id='vns450'></a>A crow there was who walked around<br>
a stone that seemed a lump of fat;<br>
“Shall I find something soft in this?<br>
And is there something tasty here?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc26'></a><a class='vns' id='vns451'></a>He finding nothing tasty there,<br>
made off: and we from Gotama<br>
depart in disappointment, too,<br>
like to the crow that tried the stone.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc27'></a><a class='vns' id='vns452'></a><span class='speaker'>Narrator</span><br>
Then full of sorrow he let slip<br>
the lute from underneath his arm,<br>
then that dejected demon<br>
disappeared just there.</p>
