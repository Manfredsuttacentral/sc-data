“I think you have true understanding, and a developed self—<br>
how have these countless kinds of suffering<br>
arisen for whoever is in the world?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1057'></a><a class='svv' id='svv5.75'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp1050'></a><a class='svsv' id='svsv5.5.2'></a>“You asked me about the origin of suffering, Mettagū,” said the Gracious One,<br>
“as I know it I will declare it to you:<br>
Because of clinging to a basis countless kinds<br>
of suffering originate for whoever is in the world.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1058'></a><a class='svv' id='svv5.76'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp1051'></a><a class='svsv' id='svsv5.5.3'></a>“The foolish one, without wisdom, clings to a basis,<br>
and comes to suffering again and again, the fool.<br>
Therefore knowing this, do not cling to a basis,<br>
seeing the birth and origin of suffering.”<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1059'></a><a class='svv' id='svv5.77'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp1052'></a><a class='svsv' id='svsv5.5.4'></a>“You have proclaimed to us what we asked you about,” said venerable Mettagū,<br>
“another thing we ask, come on, please answer it:<br>
How do the wise ones cross over the flood<br>
of birth, old age, grief, and lamentation?<br>
Please explain this to me, O sage,<br>
for this Teaching has been understood by you.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1060'></a><a class='svv' id='svv5.78'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp1053'></a><a class='svsv' id='svsv5.5.5'></a>“I shall proclaim the Teaching to you, Mettagū” said the Gracious One,<br>
“which is not hearsay in this world,<br>
which, having understood, and living mindfully, one can cross over clinging to the world.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1061'></a><a class='svv' id='svv5.79'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp1054'></a><a class='svsv' id='svsv5.5.6'></a>“I greatly rejoice in that supreme Teaching, great seer,<br>
which, having understood, and living mindfully, one can cross over clinging to the world.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1062'></a><a class='svv' id='svv5.80'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp1055'></a><a class='svsv' id='svsv5.5.7'></a>“Whatever you know, Mettagū,” said the Gracious One,<br>
“above, below, and across the middle,<br>
dispel the enjoyment of, and settling on, these things,<br>
and consciousness, and one will not remain in existence.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1063'></a><a class='svv' id='svv5.81'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp1056'></a><a class='svsv' id='svsv5.5.8'></a>“Living in this way, mindful, and heedful,<br>
the monk who lives on after giving up loved things,<br>
can, being wise, give up birth, old age,<br>
grief, lamentation, and suffering right here.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1064'></a><a class='svv' id='svv5.82'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp1057'></a><a class='svsv' id='svsv5.5.9'></a>“I greatly rejoice in this, the Great Seer’s word,” said venerable Mettagū,<br>
“O Gotama, well proclaimed is freedom from clinging.<br>
Surely the Gracious One gave up suffering,<br>
for this Teaching has been understood by you.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc10'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1065'></a><a class='svv' id='svv5.83'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp1058'></a><a class='svsv' id='svsv5.5.10'></a>“Surely they too can give up suffering,<br>
whomever you would continually advise, O Sage,<br>
therefore having met the Strong One, I revere him,<br>
perhaps the Gracious One could continuously advise me!”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc11'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1066'></a><a class='svv' id='svv5.84'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp1059'></a><a class='svsv' id='svsv5.5.11'></a>“You should know the brahmin who has true understanding, Mettagū,” said the Gracious One,<br>
“who has nothing, and is not clinging to sense existence,<br>
for he has surely crossed over the flood,<br>
without hindrance or doubt, he has crossed beyond.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc12'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1067'></a><a class='svv' id='svv5.85'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp1060'></a><a class='svsv' id='svsv5.5.12'></a>“That man here who is wise, and has true understanding,<br>
who has released the shackle of repeated existence,<br>
he is craving-free, not troubled, not yearning—<br>
he has crossed over birth and old age, I say.”</p>
