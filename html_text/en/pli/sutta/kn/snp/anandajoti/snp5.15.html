“the unmoved one, who has cut off doubt,<br>
who is perfect in everything, I have come in need with a question:</p>

<span class='add'>who</span>, on the inside and outside is seeing ‘there is nothing whatsoever’,<br>
I ask about <span class='add'>his</span> knowledge, Sakyan, how is such a one led further?”</p>

“the Realised One knows,<br>
he knows where that one stands, what he is intent on, what he is going towards.</p>

knowing deeply that it is so, and then having insight into this:<br>
this is real knowedge for him, for the brahmin who is accomplished.”</p>
