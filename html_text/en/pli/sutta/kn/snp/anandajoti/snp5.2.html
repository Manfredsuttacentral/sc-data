“Why does it not become clear?<br>
What do you say is its defilement? What is <span class='add'>the world’s</span> great fear?”</p>

“because of heedlessness and meanness it does not become clear.<br>
Hunger is its defilement, I say; suffering is <span class='add'>the world’s</span> great fear.”</p>

“What is the constraint for streams?<br>
Tell me the restraint for streams; by what are the streams shut off?”</p>

“mindfulness is the constraint for them.<br>
That is the restraint for streams, I say; by wisdom they are shut off.”</p>

“and mind and body, dear Sir,<br>
please tell me this when asked: where does this cease?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1044'></a><a class='svv' id='svv5.62'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp1037'></a><a class='svsv' id='svsv5.2.6'></a>“This question that was asked, Ajita, I can answer it! As to where mind and body ceases without remainder:<br>
with the cessation of consciousness, in this place it ceases.”</p>

when I ask the prudent one, please tell me their conduct, dear Sir.”</p>

Skilful in all things, the monk should wander mindfully.”</p>
