Whoever lives without company, not troubled,<br>

Gracious One, perhaps those living restrained in this way<br>
have crossed over birth and old age, dear Sir?<br>
I ask you, Gracious One, please tell this to me.”</p>

whoever here has given up <span class='add'>reliance on</span> what is seen,<br>
heard, or sensed, and virtue and practices,<br>
and has also given up all the countless <span class='add'>other</span> ways,<br>
who, by fully knowing craving, are pollutant-free—<br>
I say those men have crossed over the flood.”</p>

Gotama, well-proclaimed is freedom from clinging!<br>
Whoever here has given up <span class='add'>reliance on</span> what is seen,<br>
