“I have come in need with a question:<br>
On account of what did the seers and men,<br>
nobles, and brahmins, here in the world<br>
offer many sacrifices to the gods?<br>
I ask you, Gracious One, please tell this to me.”</p>

“nobles, and brahmins, here in the world,<br>
offered many sacrifices to the gods,<br>
they did so yearning, Puṇṇaka, for mundane existence,<br>
on account of old age, they offered sacrifices.”</p>

“nobles, and brahmins, here in the world,<br>
offered many sacrifices to the gods,<br>
O Gracious One, perhaps those heedful of the path of sacrifice<br>
have crossed over birth and old age, dear Sir?<br>
I ask you, Gracious One, please tell this to me.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1053'></a><a class='svv' id='svv5.71'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp1046'></a><a class='svsv' id='svsv5.4.4'></a>“They yearn and they praise, they hunger, and they offer,” said the Gracious One to Puṇṇaka,<br>
“They hunger for sense pleasures, because of gain<br>
they engage in sacrifice, excited by the passion for existence.<br>
They have not crossed over birth and old age, I say.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1054'></a><a class='svv' id='svv5.72'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp1047'></a><a class='svsv' id='svsv5.4.5'></a>“If those engaged in sacrifice have not crossed over,” said venerable Puṇṇaka,<br>
“birth and old age by their sacrifices, dear Sir,<br>
then just who in the world of the Gods and men<br>
has crossed over birth and old age, dear Sir?<br>
I ask you, Gracious One, please tell this to me.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1055'></a><a class='svv' id='svv5.73'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp1048'></a><a class='svsv' id='svsv5.4.6'></a>“The one who has discerned far and near in the world,” said the Gracious One to Puṇṇaka,<br>
“who has no turmoil anywhere in the world,<br>
who is peaceful, not incensed, not troubled, not yearning,<br>
he has crossed over birth and old age, I say.”</p>
