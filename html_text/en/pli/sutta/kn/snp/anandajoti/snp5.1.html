one who wanted to have no possessions, a brahmin perfect in the Vedas.</p>

enthusiastically asked that God:<br>

in which country, is the Lord of the World?<br>
Where having gone to can we revere the Sambuddha, the Supreme Human Being?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc21'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1003'></a><a class='svv' id='svv5.21'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp996'></a><a class='svsv' id='svsv5.1.21'></a>“The Victor is in the Kosalan’s city, Sāvatthī,<br>
