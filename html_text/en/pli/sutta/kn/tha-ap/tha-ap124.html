<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1776'></a> In the Himalayan region,<br>
there’s a mountain named Lambaka.<br>
I was dwelling at its center,<br>
a brahmin master of mantras. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1777'></a> <span class='add'>At that time</span> five thousand students<br>
were constantly surrounding me.<br>
They <span class='add'>all</span> rose earlier <span class='add'>than I</span>,<br>
<span class='add'>and were likewise</span> skilled in mantras. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1778'></a>“<span class='add'>Teacher</span>, you should know the fact that<br>
Buddha has been born in the world,<br>
bearing thirty-two great marks and<br>
eighty lesser marks upon him.<br>
The aura of the Best Victor,<br>
fathom-wide, shines just like the sun.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1779'></a>After hearing <span class='add'>his</span> students’ words,<br>
the brahmin master of mantras,<br>
setting out from <span class='add'>his own</span> ashram,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> asked directions, <span class='add'>that</span> brahmin:<br>
“In which region is <span class='add'>he</span> living,<br>
the Great Hero, the World-Leader? <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1780'></a> I will worship that direction<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> the Victor, Without Rival.<br>
And happy, with a happy heart,<br>
I will worship the Thus-Gone-One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1781'></a> Come <span class='add'>now, you</span> students, let us go;<br>
let us see <span class='add'>him</span>, the Thus-Gone-One.<br>
Having worshipped the Teacher’s feet,<br>
we will hear his dispensation.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1782'></a> One day after I had set out,<br>
I contracted a <span class='add'>bad</span> illness.<br>
I laid down beneath a <i lang='pli' translate='no'>sal</i> <span class='add'>tree</span>,<br>
in <span class='add'>great</span> pain due to that illness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1783'></a> Assembling all the students <span class='add'>then</span><br>
I asked them questions in this way:<br>
“of what sort is the virtue of<br>
the World’s Lord, the Supreme Buddha?” <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1784'></a> <span class='add'>Then</span> questioned by me they explained<br>
the Best Buddha <span class='add'>most</span> thoroughly,<br>
as well as they could see him <span class='add'>then</span><br>
<span class='add'>and</span> showed him to me face-to-face. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1785'></a> After hearing <span class='add'>the students’</span> words,<br>
I brought <span class='add'>my</span> own heart pleasure <span class='add'>then</span>.<br>
Having built a floral stupa<br>
I passed away <span class='add'>right</span> on the spot. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1786'></a> They, after burning my body,<br>
came into the Buddha’s presence.<br>
Pressing hands together <span class='add'>for him,</span><br>
they <span class='add'>all</span> worshipped the Teacher <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1787'></a> Having made a floral stupa<br>
for the Well-Gone-One, the Great Sage,<br>
for one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1788'></a> In the forty-thousandth aeon<br>
there were sixteen Kṣatriyan <span class='add'>men</span>.<br>
<span class='add'>All</span> were known as Aggisamā,<br>
wheel-turning kings with great power. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1789'></a> In the twenty-thousandth aeon,<br>
thirty-eight rulers of the earth<br>
were kings who turned the wheel <span class='add'>of law,</span><br>
and <span class='add'>all were</span> named Ghatāsana. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1790'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
