<h1>12. Ekatthambhika</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw686'></a> The Blessed One <span class='add'>named</span> Siddhattha<br>
had a large group of followers.<br>
They had taken <span class='add'>the lay</span> refuge<br>
with faith in the Thus-Gone Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw687'></a> They all gathered and decided<br>
to build a hut for the Teacher.<br>
Still in need of one more pillar<br>
they were searching the thick forest. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw688'></a> Having seen them in the forest<br>
I then went up to that group <span class='add'>there</span>.<br>
Pressing both my hands together<br>
I made inquiries of that group. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw689'></a> Those morally-restrained layfolk<br>
asked by me then gave <span class='add'>their</span> reply,<br>
“we desire to build a <i lang='pli' translate='no'>māḷa</i><br>
but we are <span class='add'>still</span> one pillar short.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw690'></a> “Give me the one pillar <span class='add'>duty</span>;<br>
I will give it to the Teacher.<br>
I will take that pillar <span class='add'>to him</span>,<br>
all of you please <span class='add'>now</span> be at ease.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw691'></a> Pleased <span class='add'>and</span> with minds <span class='add'>full of</span> delight<br>
they felled that pillar for me <span class='add'>there</span>,<br>
then having turned around to leave<br>
they went back to their own houses. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw692'></a> Not long after that big group left<br>
I then did give <span class='add'>him</span> that pillar.<br>
I was the first one to raise it,<br>
happy, <span class='add'>and</span> with a happy heart. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw693'></a> Because of the pleasure in <span class='add'>my</span> heart<br>
I was born in a god’s mansion.<br>
That lofty residence of mine<br>
was one hundred stories in height. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw694'></a> When the drums are being beaten,<br>
I am then being entertained.<br>
I was the king, Yasodhara,<br>
in the fifty-fifth aeon <span class='add'>thence</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw695'></a> There too I had a residence<br>
which was seven stories in height.<br>
Appointed with fine gabled cells<br>
there was one pillar, mind’s delight. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw696'></a> In the twenty-first aeon <span class='add'>thence</span><br>
I was the king known as Udena.<br>
There too I had a residence<br>
which was a hundred stories tall. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw697'></a> In whichever womb I’m reborn,<br>
<span class='add'>whether</span> it’s human or divine,<br>
I experience all of that;<br>
that is the fruit of one pillar. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw698'></a> In the ninety-four aeons since<br>
I gave <span class='add'>him</span> that pillar back then,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth;<br>
that is the fruit of one pillar. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw699'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
