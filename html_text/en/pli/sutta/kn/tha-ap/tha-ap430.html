<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4567'></a> In the city, Haṃsavatī,<br>
I was a cultivator then.<br>
I <span class='add'>earn my</span> living by farming,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> through it I feed <span class='add'>my</span> children. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4568'></a> <span class='add'>My</span> field back then was bountiful,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> my grain was producing seed;<br>
when the fruit-bearing time arrived,<br>
I then thought <span class='add'>about it</span> like this: <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4569'></a> “It’s not right, it is not fitting<br>
for one who knows what’s virtuous,<br>
that without giving to the monks,<br>
I should consume the best of this. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4570'></a> This Buddha’s the Impartial One,<br>
Bearing the Thirty-two Great Marks;<br>
reared by him, the monks’ Assembly<br>
is the unsurpassed merit-field. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4571'></a> I shall give a donation there,<br>
the first of each of the new crop.”<br>
Thinking about <span class='add'>it</span> like that, I<br>
was happy, with a gladdened mind. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4572'></a> <span class='add'>Then</span> carrying grain from <span class='add'>my</span> field,<br>
I went up to the Sambuddha.<br>
Having approached the Sambuddha,<br>
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> worshipping the Teacher’s feet,<br>
I spoke these words <span class='add'>to the Buddha</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4573'></a> “The new crop <span class='add'>of grain</span> has prospered;<br>
you’re the Recipient of Gifts.<br>
O Sage, showing <span class='add'>me</span> compassion,<br>
please accept it, O Eyeful One.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4574'></a> Padumuttara, World-Knower,<br>
Sacrificial Recipient,<br>
discerning what I was thinking,<br>
spoke these words <span class='add'>to me at that time</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4575'></a> “Four have entered <span class='add'>into the path</span>;<br>
four are established in <span class='add'>its</span> fruit.<br>
This monks’ Assembly is upright,<br>
settled in wisdom <span class='add'>and</span> morals. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4576'></a> Merit done for the <span class='add'>good</span> rebirths<br>
of people doing rituals,<br>
beings looking <span class='add'>to earn</span> merit,<br>
gifted for the monks, bears great fruit. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4577'></a> The new crop, so too more than that,<br>
is to be given to these monks.<br>
Proposing <span class='add'>it</span>, lead monks from the<br>
Assembly to that house <span class='add'>of yours</span>.<br>
What has been prepared in your house,<br>
give that to the monks’ Assembly.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4578'></a> Proposing <span class='add'>it</span>, leading monks, from the<br>
Assembly to that house <span class='add'>of mine</span>,<br>
what had been prepared in my house,<br>
I gave to the monks’ Assembly. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4579'></a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4580'></a> There my well-constructed mansion<br>
was <span class='add'>made of</span> gold, brightly shining.<br>
It rose up sixty leagues <span class='add'>in height,</span><br>
<span class='add'>and it</span> was thirty leagues in width. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4581'></a> The nineteenth recitation portion.<br>
That palace of mine was crowded,<br>
filled with <span class='add'>varied</span> groups of women.<br>
Eating and <span class='add'>also</span> drinking there,<br>
I live among the thirty gods. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4582'></a> And three times in succession I<br>
exercised divine rule <span class='add'>back then</span>,<br>
and five times in succession I<br>
was a monarch who turns the wheel,<br>
<span class='add'>and I enjoyed</span> much local rule,<br>
innumerable by counting. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4583'></a> Transmigrating from birth to birth,<br>
I receive unlimited wealth.<br>
I have no lack of possessions:<br>
that is the fruit of a new crop. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4584'></a> Elephant- <span class='add'>and</span> horse-vehicles,<br>
palanquins, also chariots—<br>
I am obtaining all of them:<br>
that is the fruit of a new crop. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4585'></a> New clothing <span class='add'>and likewise</span> new fruit,<br>
new food which has the best flavor—<br>
I am obtaining all of them:<br>
that is the fruit of a new crop. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4586'></a>Silk cloth and woolen blankets too,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>khoma</i> and also cotton cloth—<br>
I am obtaining all of them:<br>
that is the fruit of a new crop. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4587'></a> Groups of slave-women, groups of slaves,<br>
and women who are all decked out—<br>
I am obtaining all of them:<br>
that is the fruit of a new crop. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4588'></a> I am not cold, I am not hot;<br>
burning fever does not exist.<br>
And also mental suffering<br>
is non-existent in my mind. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4589'></a> <span class='add'>People say,</span> “Eat this,” “enjoy this,”<br>
“lit down <span class='add'>to sleep</span> in this <span class='add'>good</span> bed.”<br>
I am obtaining all of that:<br>
that is the fruit of a new crop. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4590'></a> Now is the final time for me;<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> last rebirth is proceeding.<br>
Today the fruit which I donated<br>
is always making <span class='add'>me</span> happy. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4591'></a> After donating <span class='add'>my</span> new crop,<br>
for the monks of splendid virtue,<br>
I experience eight results,<br>
in accordance with my karma. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4592-4593'></a> I’m handsome and I’m famous <span class='add'>too</span>,<br>
very wealthy and free from harm;<br>
always in the majority,<br>
my retinue has no factions.<br>
They all are giving me respect,<br>
whomever on earth I mix with.<br>
And whatever gifts there <span class='add'>may</span> be,<br>
I <span class='add'>always</span> get the first of each. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26-27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4594'></a> In the middle of the monks or<br>
face-to-face with the Best Buddha,<br>
passing over all the <span class='add'>others</span>,<br>
the donors are giving to me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4595'></a> Having given the first new crop,<br>
for the monks of splendid virtue,<br>
I am enjoying these results:<br>
that is the fruit of a new crop. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4596'></a> In the hundred thousand aeons<br>
since I gave that donation then,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that is the fruit of a new crop. <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4597'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4598'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4599'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
