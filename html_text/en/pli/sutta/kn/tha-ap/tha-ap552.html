<p><a class='jw' id='jw6294'></a> In this <span class='add'>present</span> lucky aeon<br>
Brahmā’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,<br>
known by the name of Kassapa,<br>
Best Debater, <span class='add'>Buddha,</span> arose. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6295'></a> Possessing Eighty Lesser Marks,<br>
Bearing the Thirty-Two Great Marks,<br>
Having a Fathom-Wide Aura,<br>
Gone into a Net of Light-Rays, <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6296'></a> as Comforting as is the moon,<br>
Maker of Light <span class='add'>just</span> like the sun,<br>
Quenching <span class='add'>just</span> as does a raincloud,<br>
a Mine of Gems like the ocean, <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6297'></a> Through morals like earth; through wisdom<br>
like the sky; through meditation<br>
like Himalaya; like the wind<br>
<span class='add'>he does</span> not stick to anything. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6298'></a> At that very time I was born<br>
in Benares, in a big clan,<br>
rich in grain and abundant wealth,<br>
with heaps of various gemstones. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6299'></a> Approaching the Leader, who was<br>
seated with a large retinue,<br>
I heard <span class='add'>him preaching</span> the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
undying, delighting the mind. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6300'></a> Bearing the Thirty-Two Marks like<br>
the moon with the constellations,<br>
Possessing Eighty Lesser Marks,<br>
like a regal <i lang='pli' translate='no'>sal</i> tree in bloom, <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6301'></a> Encircled by a Net of Rays,<br>
like a shining mountain of gold,<br>
Having a Fathom-Wide Aura,<br>
like the sun <span class='add'>shining</span> on a lake, <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6302'></a> Excellent Golden-Faced Victor,<br>
like a mountain <span class='add'>made</span> of gemstones,<br>
with a Heart Full of Compassion,<br>
like the ocean through <span class='add'>his</span> virtue. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6303'></a> The Ultimate Man, like Mt. Meru,<br>
<span class='add'>his</span> Praises are Famous World-wide;<br>
Widespread with Fame, the <span class='add'>Great</span> Hero,<br>
the Sage, who is the Same as Space, <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6304'></a> Heart Unattached in every place,<br>
the Leader is <span class='add'>thus</span> like the wind;<br>
Support for all living beings,<br>
the Seventh Sage is like the earth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6305'></a> <span class='add'>Kassapa,</span> Unsoiled by the World<br>
like a pink lotus by water,<br>
shines forth like a mountain of fire<br>
Burning the Bad-Speech Undergrowth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6306'></a> Everywhere, like an antidote,<br>
he Destroys the Defilement-Poison,<br>
Adorned with the Scent of Virtue,<br>
like Gandhamādana Mountain. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6307'></a> The Hero’s a Mine of Virtues<br>
like the ocean <span class='add'>is</span> of gemstones;<br>
Thoroughbred Man like a Sindh horse,<br>
he Carries Off Defilement’s Filth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6308'></a> Like a champion great soldier,<br>
he Crushes the Army of Death;<br>
he is like a wheel-turning king,<br>
Lord of Wisdom’s <span class='add'>Seven</span> Gems. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6309'></a> Just like a man of medicine,<br>
he Doctors the Illness <span class='add'>called</span> Faults;<br>
just like the very best surgeon,<br>
he Drains the Abscess <span class='add'>called False</span> Views. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6310'></a> At that time, the Torch of the World,<br>
Honored by Gods along with Men,<br>
the Sun among Men, the Victor,<br>
preached <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i> to his retinue. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6311'></a> “Giving alms <span class='add'>one becomes</span> wealthy,<br>
through morals one gains well-being,<br>
through meditation, nirvana:”<br>
thus indeed he gave instruction. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6312'></a> Everyone in the retinue<br>
hears that, <span class='add'>his</span> very sweet preaching,<br>
pure in beginning, middle, end,<br>
very tasty, like ambrosia. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6313'></a> Having heard <span class='add'>his</span> honeyed Teaching,<br>
pleased in Victor’s dispensation,<br>
going to Buddha for refuge,<br>
I praised <span class='add'>him</span> as long as <span class='add'>I</span> lived. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6314-6315'></a> At that time, for eight days <span class='add'>each</span> month,<br>
I covered over the ground of<br>
the perfumed hut <span class='add'>where lived</span> the Sage<br>
with the four types of fragrant <span class='add'>things</span>,<br>
out of my wish for that good smell<br>
for <span class='add'>my own</span> odor-free body.<br>
Then the Victor prophesied that<br>
<span class='add'>I’d</span> attain that fragrant body: <a class='vjw' id='vjw21-22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6316-6317'></a> “He who covered over the ground<br>
of <span class='add'>my</span> own perfumed hut with scents,<br>
as the result of that karma,<br>
<span class='add'>while being</span> reborn here and there,<br>
this man will be one who has a<br>
good-smelling body everywhere.<br>
Having the fragrance of virtue,<br>
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw23-24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6318'></a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6319'></a> And now in my final rebirth,<br>
I’m born in a clan of brahmins.<br>
When I was dwelling in the womb,<br>
my mother’s body was fragrant. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6320'></a> And when I was departing from<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> mother’s womb, then the city,<br>
Śrāvasti, was diffused with good<br>
scents, as though it had been perfumed. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6321'></a> And a perfumed rain of flowers,<br>
divinely-scented, delightful,<br>
and very costly incense <span class='add'>too,</span><br>
was wafted about all that time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6322'></a> And the gods rained down on that house,<br>
the house in which I had been born,<br>
a perfumed <span class='add'>rain</span> with all good-scented<br>
<span class='add'>types of</span> incense <span class='add'>and</span> flowers <span class='add'>too</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6323'></a> And while I, a lucky young man,<br>
remained in the prime of <span class='add'>my</span> youth,<br>
then the Charioteer of Men<br>
guided Sela with retinue. <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6324'></a> I <span class='add'>too</span>, along with all of them,<br>
came to the city, Śrāvasti.<br>
Seeing the Buddha’s majestic<br>
power, I went forth at that time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6325'></a> Morals, meditation, wisdom<br>
and the freedom that’s unsurpassed;<br>
cultivating <span class='add'>those</span> four things,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship. <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6326'></a> And when I was a renouncer,<br>
and when I was an arahant,<br>
and when I attained nirvana,<br>
there was then a good-smelling rain. <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6327'></a> The fragrance of my body is always blowing<br>
costly sandalwood, champaka and blue lotus.<br>
In just that way, gone here and there I’m perfuming,<br>
suppressing <span class='add'>all</span> different scents in every respect. <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6328'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6329'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6330'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
