<p><a class='jw' id='jw3758'></a> In the Himalayan region,<br>
there’s a mountain named Sobhita.<br>
My well-constructed hermitage<br>
was built by <span class='add'>my</span> own students <span class='add'>there</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3759'></a> There were many canopies there,<br>
and flowering Chinese chaste trees.<br>
There were many wood-apple trees,<br>
and <i lang='pli' translate='no'>jīvajīvakas</i> in bloom. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3760'></a>There were many <i lang='pli' translate='no'>nigguṇḍi</i> trees,<br>
jujube, also gooseberry,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>phārusaka</i> and bottle-gourds<br>
and white lotus flowers in bloom. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3761'></a> There was <i lang='pli' translate='no'>āḷakā</i> and bel there,<br>
plantain, and also citron trees;<br>
there was lots of sugarcane there,<br>
arjuna and <i lang='pli' translate='no'>piyaṅguka</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3762'></a> Neem, <i lang='pli' translate='no'>salalā</i>, yellow<br>
cheesewoods, banyan, wood-apple trees,<br>
my hermitage was one like that;<br>
I lived <span class='add'>there</span> with <span class='add'>my</span> students then. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3763'></a> Anomadassi, Blessed One,<br>
the Self-Become One, World-Leader,<br>
looking for a secluded place,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> came up to my hermitage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3764'></a> When the Great Hero had approached,<br>
Anomadassi of Great Fame,<br>
suddenly <span class='add'>some</span> internal pain,<br>
arose for the Lord of the World. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3765-3766'></a> Wandering in the hermitage,<br>
I saw the Leader of the World.<br>
Having approached the Sambuddha,<br>
the Eyeful One, he of Great Fame,<br>
and having seen his deportment,<br>
I diagnosed him at that time:<br>
“without a doubt <span class='add'>some</span> illness has<br>
been born <span class='add'>inside</span> of the Buddha.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw8-9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3767'></a>Wishing to practice medicine,<br>
I ran back to the hermitage.<br>
In the presence of my students,<br>
I then addressed <span class='add'>all my</span> students. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3768'></a> All the students were respectful;<br>
having listened to what I said,<br>
they assembled in one group for<br>
me, who respected the Teacher. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3769'></a> Having quickly scaled a mountain,<br>
I fetched all of the healing herbs.<br>
Making <span class='add'>them</span> into a liquid,<br>
I gave <span class='add'>it</span> to the Best Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3770'></a> When the Great Hero consumed <span class='add'>it</span>,<br>
the Omniscient One, World-Leader,<br>
quickly <span class='add'>that</span> illness was suppressed<br>
for the Well-Gone-One, the Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3771'></a> Having seen <span class='add'>his</span> distress relieved,<br>
Anomadassi of Great Fame,<br>
after sitting on his own seat,<br>
spoke these verses <span class='add'>to us back then</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3772'></a> “This one who gave me medicine<br>
and <span class='add'>thereby</span> relieved my disease,<br>
I shall relate details of him;<br>
<span class='add'>all of</span> you listen to my words: <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3773'></a> For one hundred thousand aeons<br>
he’ll delight in the world of gods.<br>
When instruments are sounded there,<br>
this one constantly will be thrilled. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3774'></a> Coming to the world of humans,<br>
incited by <span class='add'>his</span> wholesome roots,<br>
a thousand times he’ll be a king,<br>
a king who turns the wheel <span class='add'>of law</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3775'></a> In the fifty-fifth aeon <span class='add'>hence</span><br>
he’ll be the king named Anoma,<br>
lord of the grove of rose-apples,<br>
victorious on <span class='add'>all</span> four sides. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3776'></a> A wheel-turning king with great strength,<br>
possessor of the seven gems,<br>
he will exercise sovereignty,<br>
making even the heavens shake. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3777'></a> <span class='add'>Whether</span> born human or divine,<br>
he’ll be one with little disease.<br>
Throwing away <span class='add'>his</span> possessions,<br>
he’ll transcend illness in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3778'></a> Aeons beyond measure from now,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3779'></a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
knowing well all the defilements,<br>
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3780'></a> Burning up <span class='add'>all his</span> defilements<br>
he will cross the flood of clinging.<br>
He’ll be the Teacher’s follower,<br>
<span class='add'>the monk</span> whose name is Bakkula. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3781'></a> Having come to know all of this,<br>
Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,<br>
seated in the monks’ Assembly<br>
will place <span class='add'>him</span> in that foremost place.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3782'></a> Anomadassi, Blessed One,<br>
the Self-Become One, World-Leader,<br>
looking for a secluded place,<br>
came to my hermitage <span class='add'>back then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3783'></a> With all the healing herbs I served<br>
the Great Hero who had approached,<br>
Omniscient One, the World-Leader,<br>
<span class='add'>feeling well-</span>pleased by <span class='add'>my</span> own hands. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3784'></a> I can’t even <span class='add'>start</span> to spend the<br>
harvest of that seed well-planted,<br>
that karma I did well for him,<br>
well done by me so long ago. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3785'></a> My gains were well-obtained be me<br>
who saw the Leader <span class='add'>of the World</span>;<br>
through the remainder of that deed,<br>
I realized the deathless state. <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3786'></a> Having come to know all of that,<br>
Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,<br>
seated in the monks’ Assembly<br>
<span class='add'>has</span> placed in that foremost place. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3787'></a> In the vast number of aeons<br>
since I did that karma back then,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that is the fruit of medicine. <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3788'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
All defilements are exhausted;<br>
now there will be no more rebirth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3789'></a> My being in Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3790'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
