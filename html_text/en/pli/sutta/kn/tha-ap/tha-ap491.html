<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5193'></a> When Dipaṅkara was Buddha,<br>
the Victor said of Sumedha:<br>
“Aeons beyond measure from now,<br>
this one will become a Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5194'></a> The one named Māyā’s going to be<br>
the birth-mother of this <span class='add'>person</span>;<br>
Suddhodhana the father’s name;<br>
this one will be <span class='add'>named</span> Gotama. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5195'></a> Being one bent on exertion,<br>
having practiced austerities,<br>
the Sambuddha will awaken<br>
Great Famed, at the Bodhi tree’s roots. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5196'></a> Upatissa and Kolita<br>
will be the <span class='add'>two</span> chief followers;<br>
the one whose name is Ānanda<br>
will attend upon this Victor. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5197'></a> Khemā and Uppalavaṇṇā<br>
will be chief female followers;<br>
Citta and Ālavaka will<br>
be the chief pious laymen. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5198'></a> Khujjuttarā, Nandamātā<br>
will be chief pious laywomen;<br>
the Bodhi tree of this Hero<br>
is known as the Aśvattha tree.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5199'></a> After having heard those words of<br>
the Great Sage, the Unequaled One,<br>
overjoyed, <span class='add'>both</span> gods and men, are<br>
praising <span class='add'>him</span>, hands pressed together. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5200-5201'></a> At that time I was a young man,<br>
well-educated, named Megha.<br>
Having heard <span class='add'>that</span> best prophesy<br>
for Sumedha, <span class='add'>then</span> a great sage,<br>
cultivating confidence in<br>
Sumedha, font of compassion,<br>
<span class='add'>when</span> that hero renounced the world,<br>
I renounced right along with <span class='add'>him</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8-9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5202'></a> Restrained in the monastic rules,<br>
and <span class='add'>also</span> in the five senses,<br>
he lived pure, mindful, a hero,<br>
doer of what the Victor taught. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5203'></a> <span class='add'>While</span> I was living in that way,<br>
I strayed away from the good road,<br>
urged into bad behavior by<br>
a certain evil friend <span class='add'>of mine</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5204'></a> Having been controlled by reason,<br>
I fell from the dispensation;<br>
afterward, by that bad friend, the<br>
murder of <span class='add'>my</span> mother was schemed. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5205'></a> I did no-interval karma,<br>
and I killed with an evil mind;<br>
I fell from there <span class='add'>right into</span> hell,<br>
born in a very cruel <span class='add'>place</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5206'></a> Being gone to that woeful state,<br>
I long transmigrated in pain,<br>
not seeing the Hero again,<br>
Sumedha, the Bull among Men. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5207'></a> In this aeon, in the ocean,<br>
I was a <i lang='pli' translate='no'>timiṅgala</i> fish.<br>
Having seen a ship in the sea,<br>
I approached it looking for food. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5208'></a> Seeing me, the traders, afraid,<br>
remembered the Best of Buddhas;<br>
I heard a huge sound shouted out,<br>
“Gotama!” <span class='add'>they cried in terror</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5209'></a> Recalling the past perception,<br>
I passed away <span class='add'>right</span> on the spot.<br>
I was reborn in Śrāvasti,<br>
a brahmin in a high-ranked clan. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5210'></a> My name was Dhammarucī <span class='add'>then</span>,<br>
a loather of every evil.<br>
Having seen the Lamp of the World,<br>
being <span class='add'>only</span> seven years old, <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5211'></a> I went to great Jetavana,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> went forth into homelessness.<br>
I approach the Buddha three times<br>
<span class='add'>every</span> night, also <span class='add'>every</span> day. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5212'></a> Seeing <span class='add'>me</span>, seeing <span class='add'>me,</span> the Sage<br>
called <span class='add'>me</span> “long time Dhammarucī.”<br>
After that I told the Buddha<br>
<span class='add'>how my</span> past karma had progressed: <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5213'></a> Very long, marked with hundreds of good deeds,<br>
conditions <span class='add'>then</span> gradually purified.<br>
Today I am looking closely indeed,<br>
I am seeing your body without compare. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5214'></a> Very long, darkness is destroyed by it.<br>
Through guarding purity, the stream has been cleansed.<br>
Very long, <span class='add'>now</span> purified without fault,<br>
is the eye made out of knowledge, O Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5215'></a> A long time, <span class='add'>now</span> come together with you;<br>
not destroyed, again the interval was long;<br>
today, again come together with you,<br>
O Gotama, deeds do not <span class='add'>just</span> disappear. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5216'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5217'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5218'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
