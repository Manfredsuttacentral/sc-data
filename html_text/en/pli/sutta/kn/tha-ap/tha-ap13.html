<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw674'></a> When the World-Leader Siddhattha,<br>
the Best Biped had reached nirvana,<br>
his words had been spread; many folks<br>
had embraced <span class='add'>his</span> dispensation. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw675'></a> With a pleased heart <span class='add'>and</span> happy mind<br>
I had a lion-throne fashioned.<br>
Having had the lion-throne made,<br>
I had a foot-stool constructed. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw676'></a> <span class='add'>And then</span> I had a house built there<br>
<span class='add'>to shield</span> the lion-throne from rain.<br>
Due to the pleasure in my heart<br>
I was reborn in Tusitā. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw677'></a> A heavenly mansion, well-built,<br>
existed at that time for me.<br>
In length it measured twenty-four,<br>
in width <span class='add'>another</span> fourteen leagues. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw678'></a> Seven thousand <span class='add'>lovely</span> maidens<br>
were always waiting on me <span class='add'>then</span>.<br>
There was a couch made out of gold<br>
well-fashioned in the mansion <span class='add'>there</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw679'></a> Elephant- and horse-carriages,<br>
and divine carriages served <span class='add'>me</span>.<br>
Palaces and also litters<br>
were produced according to wish. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw680'></a> Couches constructed out of gems<br>
and many other costly things<br>
always came into being for me;<br>
that’s the fruit of a lion-throne. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw681'></a> I am always climbing up steps<br>
made of gold and made of silver,<br>
made of crystal, made of lapis;<br>
that is the fruit of the foot-stool. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw682'></a> In the ninety-four aeons since<br>
I performed that act <span class='add'>of merit</span>,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth;<br>
that is the fruit of good karma. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw683'></a> There were three men <span class='add'>all</span> named Inda<br>
seventy-three aeons ago;<br>
there were three <span class='add'>more</span> named Sumana<br>
seventy-two aeons ago; <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw684'></a> <span class='add'>and</span> seventy aeons ago<br>
there were three <span class='add'>kings</span> named Varuṇa;<br>
they were lords of four continents<br>
possessors of the seven gems. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw685'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
