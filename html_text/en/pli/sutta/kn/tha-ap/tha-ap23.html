<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw813'></a> Close to the Himalayan range<br>
<span class='add'>on</span> the mountain called Nisabha<br>
my ashram is very well made,<br>
a well-constructed hall of leaves. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw814'></a> Famed ascetic with matted hair,<br>
Kosiya was <span class='add'>my</span> name <span class='add'>back then</span>.<br>
Solitary, with no second,<br>
I did live on Nisabha then. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw815'></a> At that time I was not eating<br>
fruits and roots and <span class='add'>freshly-picked</span> leaves.<br>
I was always subsisting on<br>
the stuff that fell into my bowl. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw816'></a> I disturbed no mode of living,<br>
giving up <span class='add'>my own</span> life itself.<br>
My own heart was satisfied as<br>
I rejected <span class='add'>all</span> harmful ways. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw817'></a> Whenever there arose in me<br>
a mind heated up by passion,<br>
reflecting on it by myself,<br>
remaining calm I would tame it: <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw818'></a> “You’re aroused in what’s arousing,<br>
you are defiled in what defiles,<br>
you fool yourself in foolish things<br>
<span class='add'>so</span> you should leave the forest <span class='add'>now</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw819'></a> This is the habitation of<br>
the pure <span class='add'>and</span> stainless ascetics.<br>
Do not sully that purity;<br>
you ought to leave the forest <span class='add'>now</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw820'></a> Having become a homeless one,<br>
you always get what is fitting.<br>
Don’t you transgress against them both;<br>
you ought to leave the forest <span class='add'>now</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw821'></a> The wood left from a funeral pyre<br>
is not made use of anywhere:<br>
in the village or the jungle<br>
it’s not approved as firewood. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw822'></a> You are just like that firebrand,<br>
neither layman nor <span class='add'>yet</span> wise man.<br>
Today you’ve departed from both<br>
<span class='add'>so</span> you should leave the forest <span class='add'>now</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw823'></a> What then would that produce for you?<br>
To what does this give birth for you?<br>
Giving up my practice of faith<br>
results in so much idleness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw824'></a> The wise are going to despise you<br>
as a householder <span class='add'>dislikes</span> dirt.<br>
Sages, having rooted <span class='add'>you</span> out<br>
will always cast blame upon you. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw825'></a> The wise ones will speak out against<br>
you leaving the dispensation.<br>
You’ll receive no co-residence;<br>
what are you going to live on <span class='add'>then</span>? <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw826'></a> A strong elephant will approach<br>
an elephant who’s thrice-rutting,<br>
a tusker sixty years of age<br>
and drive him away from the herd. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw827'></a> Living in exile from the herd<br>
he’s not happy nor is he pleased.<br>
Suffering with <span class='add'>his</span> mind depressed,<br>
full of remorse, he will tremble. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw828'></a> Just like that the cruel ascetics<br>
are <span class='add'>surely</span> going to throw you out.<br>
Being exiled by them you won’t<br>
feel happiness or pleasure <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw829'></a> If by day or by night you are<br>
pierced through with the arrow of grief,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> you will burn with pain just like<br>
the tusker exiled from the herd. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw830'></a> Just as a pretty iron tool<br>
is not taken out anywhere,<br>
so you, without moral restraint,<br>
won’t be invited anywhere. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw831'></a> Even if you’re dwelling at home<br>
what are you going to live on <span class='add'>there</span>?<br>
You do not have a heap of wealth<br>
from your mother and <span class='add'>your</span> father. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw832'></a> Having done <span class='add'>hard</span> work by oneself<br>
<span class='add'>much</span> sweat flows out of the body.<br>
Thus earning a living at home,<br>
you won’t think it <span class='add'>so</span> excellent.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw833'></a> In that way I carried on there<br>
<span class='add'>whenever</span> my mind was defiled.<br>
Making varied <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-speeches<br>
I warded off my evil heart. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw834'></a> While I was living in this way<br>
dwelling <span class='add'>so</span> very thoughtfully<br>
<span class='add'>fully</span> thirty thousand years passed<br>
in my forest <span class='add'>hermitage there</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw835'></a> Seeing my love of thoughtfulness<br>
<span class='add'>in</span> seeking <span class='add'>for</span> the supreme goal,<br>
Padumuttara the Buddha<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> came to the place where I was. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw836'></a> The Bright Hue of Wild Mangosteen,<br>
Incomparable, Unmeasurable,<br>
the Buddha, Unrivaled in Form,<br>
walked back and forth <span class='add'>across</span> the sky. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw837'></a> Like a regal <i lang='pli' translate='no'>sal</i> tree in bloom,<br>
like lightening inside of a cloud,<br>
the Buddha, Peerless in Knowledge,<br>
walked back and forth <span class='add'>across</span> the sky. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw838'></a> Not frightened, like the king of beasts;<br>
prideful like an elephant-king;<br>
playful as a tiger-king he<br>
walked back and forth <span class='add'>across</span> the sky. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw839'></a> Shining like a coin made of gold<br>
<span class='add'>or even</span> like glowing embers,<br>
like a wish-fulfilling gem he<br>
walked back and forth <span class='add'>across</span> the sky. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw840'></a> Like Mount Kailās in purity,<br>
like the moon on the fifteenth day,<br>
like the <span class='add'>blazing</span> midday sun he<br>
walked back and forth <span class='add'>across</span> the sky. <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw841'></a> Seeing him walk across the sky<br>
at that time I thought in this way:<br>
“Is this creature some sort of god?<br>
If not, is this one <span class='add'>just</span> a man? <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw842'></a> I’ve never heard of nor have seen<br>
a man as great as this one <span class='add'>seems</span>.<br>
Surely he knows <span class='add'>secret</span> mantras;<br>
<span class='add'>I think</span> this must be the Teacher.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw843'></a> Having thought about it like that<br>
I brought pleasure to <span class='add'>my</span> own heart.<br>
And I then gathered together<br>
various flowers and perfumes. <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw844'></a> Spreading out a seat of flowers<br>
I <span class='add'>then</span> spoke these words <span class='add'>to Buddha</span>,<br>
Good-Hearted One, the Mind’s Delight,<br>
the Charioteer of Men, the Top: <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw845'></a> “O Hero, I’ve spread out this seat<br>
which is a fitting one for you.<br>
Bringing laughter to my <span class='add'>own</span> heart<br>
please sit on this seat of flowers.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw846'></a> The Blessed One did sit down there<br>
unfrightened like a lion<span class='add'>-king</span>,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> the Buddha <span class='add'>remained</span> a week<br>
on that excellent floral seat. <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw847'></a> Worshipping <span class='add'>him</span> I stood <span class='add'>right there</span><br>
for <span class='add'>all</span> those seven nights and days.<br>
Rising up from meditation<br>
the Teacher, Best One in the World, <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw848'></a> declaring my karmic <span class='add'>result</span><br>
<span class='add'>then</span> did speak these words <span class='add'>to me there</span>:<br>
“Practice Buddha-recollection,<br>
<span class='add'>it’s</span> the supreme meditation. <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw849'></a> Cultivating this mindfulness<br>
will be fulfilling mentally.<br>
For thirty thousand aeons you<br>
will delight in the world of gods. <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw850'></a> Eighty times as the king of gods<br>
you will exercise divine rule.<br>
A thousand times you’re going to be<br>
wheel-turning king of a country. <a class='vjw' id='vjw38'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw851'></a> <span class='add'>And you will have</span> much local rule<br>
innumerable by counting.<br>
You’ll experience all of that:<br>
fruit of Buddha-recollection. <a class='vjw' id='vjw39'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw852'></a> Transmigrating from birth to birth<br>
you will receive many riches.<br>
In wealth never deficiency:<br>
fruit of Buddha-recollection. <a class='vjw' id='vjw40'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw853'></a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw41'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw854'></a> Discarding eight hundred million<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> many slaves <span class='add'>and</span> workers <span class='add'>too</span>,<br>
you’ll renounce in the great Teaching<br>
of Gotama the Blessed One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw42'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw855'></a> Satisfying the Sambuddha,<br>
Gotama, the Bull of Śākyas,<br>
you will be known as Subhūti,<br>
a follower of the Teacher. <a class='vjw' id='vjw43'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw856'></a> Seated in the <span class='add'>monks’</span> assembly<br>
he’ll fix you in two foremost spots:<br>
in the group of gift-receivers,<br>
and also of forest-dwellers.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw44'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw857'></a> Having said this, the Sambuddha<br>
who was named for the lotus flower,<br>
the Hero flew into the sky<br>
just like a swan-king in the air. <a class='vjw' id='vjw45'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw858'></a> <span class='add'>Thus</span> instructed by the World-Chief<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> having praised the Thus-Gone-One,<br>
satisfied I always practiced<br>
supreme Buddha-recollection. <a class='vjw' id='vjw46'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw859'></a> Due to that karma done very well<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw47'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw860'></a> Eighty times as the king of gods<br>
I did exercise divine rule,<br>
and <span class='add'>too</span> a thousand times I was<br>
a wheel-turning monarch <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw48'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw861'></a> <span class='add'>And I did have</span> much local rule<br>
innumerable by counting.<br>
I experienced supreme success:<br>
fruit of Buddha-recollection. <a class='vjw' id='vjw49'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw862'></a> Transmigrating from birth to birth<br>
I did receive many riches.<br>
In wealth never deficiency:<br>
fruit of Buddha-recollection. <a class='vjw' id='vjw50'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw863'></a> In the hundred thousand aeons<br>
since I performed that <span class='add'>good</span> karma,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth;<br>
fruit of Buddha-recollection. <a class='vjw' id='vjw51'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw864'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw52'></a></p>
