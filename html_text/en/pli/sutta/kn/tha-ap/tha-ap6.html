<h1>4. Anuruddha</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw423'></a> I caught a glimpse of the World-Chief,<br>
the Blessed One <span class='add'>named</span> Sumedha,<br>
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,<br>
while he was dwelling in solitude. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw424'></a> So I approached that Sambuddha,<br>
Sumedha, the Chief of the World,<br>
and holding up hands pressed together<br>
I said to <span class='add'>him</span>, the Best Buddha: <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw425'></a> “With your permission, Great Hero<br>
o World’s Best One, O Bull of Men,<br>
I shall light a lamp for you while<br>
you meditate beneath that tree.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw426'></a> That Wise One signaled his assent<br>
the Self-Existent, Best Debater.<br>
I then contrived a mechanism<br>
by piercing through some tree <span class='add'>trunks there</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw427'></a> I set afire a thousand wicks<br>
for the Buddha, the World’s Kinsman.<br>
For a week I kept them <span class='add'>all</span> lit<br>
<span class='add'>and then</span> those lamps were extinguished. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw428'></a> Due to the pleasure in <span class='add'>my</span> heart<br>
and that intention and resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body<br>
I’m born in a <span class='add'>divine</span> mansion. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw429'></a> There was a pillar, well-proportioned<br>
for me born in that divine state.<br>
It blazed forth on every side <span class='add'>then</span>:<br>
that is the fruit of giving lamps. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw430'></a> On every side for a whole league<br>
I <span class='add'>myself</span> shined forth at that time.<br>
I surpassed all the <span class='add'>other</span> gods:<br>
that is the fruit of giving lamps. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw431'></a> For thirty aeons, king of gods<br>
I exercised divine rule <span class='add'>then</span>.<br>
No one at all neglected me:<br>
that is the fruit of giving lamps. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw432'></a> And also eight and twenty times<br>
I was a wheel-turning monarch.<br>
Both day and night I could <span class='add'>then</span> see<br>
an entire league surrounding <span class='add'>me</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw433'></a> With knowledge of one thousand worlds,<br>
I see in the dispensation.<br>
The “divine eye” is <span class='add'>now</span> attained:<br>
that is the fruit of giving lamps. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw434'></a> That Sambuddha named Sumedha<br>
lived thirty thousand aeons hence.<br>
To him a lamp was given by me<br>
with a mind that was very clear. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw435'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw436'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught!</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw437'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>

<p>Thus indeed Venerable Anuruddha Thera spoke these verses.</p>
