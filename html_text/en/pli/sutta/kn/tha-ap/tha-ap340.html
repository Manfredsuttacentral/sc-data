<h1>335. {338.} Uttareyyadāyaka</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3021'></a> In the city, Haṃsavatī,<br>
I was a brahmin at that time,<br>
a scholar <span class='add'>who</span> knew the mantras,<br>
a master of the three Vedas. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3022'></a> I was honored by <span class='add'>my</span> students,<br>
of good birth, well-educated,<br>
I went out from the city then<br>
for a water-consecration. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3023'></a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
was the Master of Everything.<br>
The Victor entered the city<br>
with one thousand undefiled ones. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3024'></a> Seeing <span class='add'>him</span> surrounded by saints,<br>
I brought <span class='add'>great</span> pleasure to my heart,<br>
as though made free of lust by <span class='add'>just</span><br>
seeing <span class='add'>him</span>, the Good-Looking One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3025'></a> Hands pressed together on <span class='add'>my</span> head<br>
I worshipped the Compliant One.<br>
Happy, with pleasure in <span class='add'>my</span> heart,<br>
I donated an upper cloak. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3026'></a> Taking it with both of my hands,<br>
I threw <span class='add'>that</span> cloak <span class='add'>into the sky</span>.<br>
<span class='add'>That</span> cloak became a canopy<br>
as big as Buddha’s retinue. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3027'></a> It remained <span class='add'>there</span> covering <span class='add'>that</span><br>
massive group of monks and others<br>
going about in search of alms;<br>
then <span class='add'>that miracle</span> made me smile. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3028'></a> When <span class='add'>he</span> departed from the house,<br>
the Self-Become One, Chief Person,<br>
the Teacher, standing in the road,<br>
gave me this expression of thanks: <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3029'></a> “I shall relate details of him<br>
who, happy, heart <span class='add'>filled with</span> pleasure,<br>
made a gift of this cloak to me;<br>
<span class='add'>all of</span> you listen to my words: <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3030'></a> For thirty thousand aeons he<br>
will delight in the world of gods.<br>
Fifty times the lord of the gods,<br>
he will exercise divine rule. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3031'></a> While he, endowed with good karma,<br>
is dwelling in the world of gods,<br>
there will be a cloth canopy<br>
a hundred leagues on every side. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3032'></a> And thirty-six times he will be<br>
a king who turns the wheel <span class='add'>of law</span>,<br>
<span class='add'>and he will have</span> much local rule,<br>
innumerable by counting. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3033'></a> While he, endowed with good karma,<br>
is transmigrating in the world,<br>
everything wished for with <span class='add'>his</span> mind<br>
will be realized, all the time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3034'></a>This man is going to receive<br>
cloth which is very expensive:<br>
silk cloth and woolen blankets too,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>khoma</i> and also cotton cloth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3035'></a> Everything wished for with <span class='add'>his</span> mind,<br>
this man is going to receive.<br>
He’s always going to enjoy<br>
the result of one piece of cloth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3036'></a> And afterwards, having gone forth,<br>
incited by <span class='add'>his</span> wholesome roots,<br>
he will realize for himself<br>
the Blessed Gotama’s Teaching. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3037'></a> O! That karma well done by me<br>
for the Omniscient One, Great Sage!<br>
Having given a single cloak,<br>
I have attained the deathless state. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3038'></a> When I am in a pavilion,<br>
a tree-root or an empty house,<br>
a cloth canopy is carried<br>
for me, a fathom on each side. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3039'></a> And because of <span class='add'>that</span> robe <span class='add'>I gave,</span><br>
I’m dressed <span class='add'>in clothes</span> without asking.<br>
I receive food <span class='add'>and also</span> drink:<br>
that’s the fruit of an upper cloak. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3040'></a> In the hundred thousand aeons<br>
since I did that <span class='add'>good</span> karma then,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that is the fruit of giving cloth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3041'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
