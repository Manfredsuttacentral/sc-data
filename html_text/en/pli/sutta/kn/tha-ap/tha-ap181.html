<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2142'></a> In the city, Bandhumatī,<br>
I was a well-trained physician,<br>
bringing many folks happiness<br>
when patients suffered great <span class='add'>illness</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2143'></a> Having seen a monk who was sick,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> moral <span class='add'>as too</span> very bright,<br>
with a pleased heart <span class='add'>and</span> happy mind,<br>
I gave <span class='add'>him some</span> medicine then. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2144'></a> That monk with well-guarded senses<br>
became healthy because of that.<br>
He was Vipassi’s attendant,<br>
known by the name of Asoka. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2145'></a> In the ninety-one aeons since<br>
I gave <span class='add'>him</span> medicinal herbs,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that is the fruit of medicine. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2146'></a> In the eighth aeon after that<br>
the one known as Sabbosadha<br>
was a wheel-turner with great strength,<br>
possessor of the seven gems. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2147'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>

<p>Thus indeed Venerable Tikicchaka Thera spoke these verses.</p>
