<p><a class='jw' id='jw5505'></a> <span class='add'>My</span> name <span class='add'>back then</span> was Varuṇa,<br>
a brahmin master of mantras.<br>
After throwing away ten sons,<br>
I plunged into the forest then. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5506'></a> Making a well-built hermitage,<br>
well-proportioned <span class='add'>and</span> beautiful,<br>
constructing a hall of leaves <span class='add'>there</span>,<br>
I am living in the forest. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5507'></a> Padumuttara, World-Knower,<br>
Sacrificial Recipient,<br>
with a desire to lift me up,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> came up to my hermitage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5508'></a> Throughout that forest grove, there was<br>
a huge effulgence <span class='add'>of his light</span>.<br>
By the Buddha’s special powers<br>
he lit up the forest back then. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5509'></a> After seeing that miracle<br>
of the Best Buddha, Neutral One,<br>
taking a satchel made of leaves,<br>
I filled <span class='add'>it</span> with fruit at that time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5510'></a> Having gone up to the Buddha,<br>
I gave <span class='add'>him the fruit</span> with the bag.<br>
The Buddha, with pity for me,<br>
spoke these words <span class='add'>to me at that time</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5511'></a> “After bringing a <i lang='pli' translate='no'>khārī</i>-load,<br>
you, come along behind me <span class='add'>now</span>,<br>
and when the Assembly eats it,<br>
there will be good karma for you. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5512'></a> Taking that satchel <span class='add'>of leaves</span>, I<br>
gave <span class='add'>it</span> to the monks’ Assembly.<br>
After having pleased <span class='add'>my</span> heart there,<br>
I was reborn in Tusitā. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5513'></a> There, bound up with <span class='add'>my</span> good karma,<br>
I am enjoying, all the time,<br>
dances and songs <span class='add'>performed for me</span>,<br>
also speeches which are divine. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5514'></a> In whichever womb I’m reborn,<br>
<span class='add'>whether</span> it’s human or divine,<br>
I have no lack of possessions:<br>
that is the fruit of giving fruit. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5515'></a> Having given the Buddha fruit,<br>
I am exercising lordship<br>
through the four great continents,<br>
including oceans and mountains. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5516'></a> As far as they, the flocks of birds,<br>
are flying across the sky, they<br>
too obey my authority:<br>
that is the fruit of giving fruit. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5517'></a> <span class='add'>All</span> the spirits, ghosts, and demons,<br>
the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kumbhaṇḍas</i> and <i lang='pli' translate='no'>garuḷas</i>,<br>
throughout <span class='add'>that</span> grove in the forest,<br>
approach <span class='add'>in order to</span> serve me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5518'></a> Turtles <span class='add'>and</span> dogs <span class='add'>and</span> honey-bees,<br>
both gadflies and mosquitos; they<br>
too obey my authority:<br>
that is the fruit of giving fruit. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5519'></a> The birds that are called Suparṇas<br>
born to birds <span class='add'>but</span> having great strength,<br>
they too go to me for refuge:<br>
that is the fruit of giving fruit. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5520'></a> Cobra-gods who have long lives,<br>
superpowers, <span class='add'>also</span> great fame; they<br>
too obey my authority:<br>
that is the fruit of giving fruit. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5521'></a> Lions and tigers and leopards,<br>
bears, wolves, <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kara bānā</i> bears; they<br>
too obey my authority:<br>
that is the fruit of giving fruit. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5522'></a> Those who live in herbs and in grass,<br>
also those who live in the sky;<br>
they all go to me for refuge:<br>
that is the fruit of giving fruit. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5523'></a> Hard to see <span class='add'>and</span> very subtle,<br>
deep, very well explicated;<br>
having seen <span class='add'>that Teaching</span> I dwell:<br>
that is the fruit of giving fruit. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5524'></a> The eight deliverances seen,<br>
I am <span class='add'>now</span> dwelling, undefiled;<br>
energetic, intelligent:<br>
that is the fruit of giving fruit. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5525'></a> Those Buddha’s sons, with the eight fruits,<br>
free of flaws <span class='add'>and</span> very famous,<br>
I am <span class='add'>now also</span> one of them:<br>
that is the fruit of giving fruit. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5526'></a> Mastering special knowledges,<br>
incited by <span class='add'>my</span> wholesome roots,<br>
knowing well all the defilements,<br>
I am <span class='add'>now</span> living, undefiled. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5527'></a> Three knowledges, powers attained,<br>
are Buddha’s sons, the greatly famed,<br>
who are endowed with “divine ear”:<br>
I am <span class='add'>now also</span> one of them. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5528'></a> In the hundred thousand aeons,<br>
since I gave <span class='add'>him</span> that fruit back then,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that is the fruit of giving fruit. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5529'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5530'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5531'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
