<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5811'></a> One hundred thousand aeons hence<br>
the Leader arose <span class='add'>in the world</span>,<br>
the Hero, Friend of Every World,<br>
who name was Padumuttara. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5812-5813'></a> Being a brahmin at that time,<br>
distinguished, a Vedic master,<br>
wandering during siesta,<br>
I saw the Leader of the World,<br>
explaining the Four <span class='add'>Noble</span> Truths,<br>
awakening the world with gods,<br>
praising in the multitude the<br>
top of those with varied discourse. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2-3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5814-5816'></a> At that time, with a gladdened heart,<br>
inviting <span class='add'>him</span>, the Thus-Gone-One,<br>
decorating a pavilion<br>
with <span class='add'>bolts</span> of cloth diversely dyed,<br>
lit up by various gemstones,<br>
I fed <span class='add'>him</span> with the monks <span class='add'>in it</span>.<br>
Having fed <span class='add'>them all</span> for a week<br>
diverse, foremost <span class='add'>and</span> tasty food,<br>
worshipping <span class='add'>him</span> and followers<br>
with flowers of various hues,<br>
falling down in front of <span class='add'>his</span> feet,<br>
I aspired <span class='add'>to attain</span> that place. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4-6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5617-5819'></a> Then the Excellent Sage, Sole Hoard<br>
of the Taste of Compassion, said:<br>
“Look at that excellent brahmin,<br>
<span class='add'>with</span> face and eyes <span class='add'>like</span> lotuses,<br>
possessing much joy and delight,<br>
<span class='add'>his</span> body hair growing upward,<br>
<span class='add'>his</span> large eyes extremely mirthful,<br>
greedy for my dispensation,<br>
fallen down in front of my feet,<br>
happily turned toward one <span class='add'>purpose:</span><br>
he’s wishing for that <span class='add'>foremost</span> place<br>
<span class='add'>of preachers with</span> varied discourse. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7-9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5820'></a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5821'></a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
named Kumāra-Kassapa, he<br>
will be the Teacher’s follower. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5822'></a> Through the power of that cloth with<br>
varied flowers and gems <span class='add'>as well</span>,<br>
he will attain the foremost <span class='add'>place</span><br>
of <span class='add'>preachers</span> with varied discourse.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5823'></a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5824'></a> Touring the space of existence<br>
like an actor upon the stage,<br>
the son of a deer <span class='add'>named</span> Sākhā,<br>
I entered the womb of a doe. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5825'></a> <span class='add'>And</span> then while I was in the womb,<br>
<span class='add'>my mother’s</span> turn to die stood nigh.<br>
Turned out by Sākhā, my mother<br>
went to Nigrodha for refuge. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5826'></a> By that deer-king <span class='add'>Nigrodha</span>, she<br>
was released from <span class='add'>her pending</span> death.<br>
Sacrificing his life <span class='add'>instead</span>,<br>
<span class='add'>Nigrodha</span> then advised me thus: <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5827'></a> “Only Nigrodha should be served;<br>
don’t keep company with Sākhā.<br>
Better death in Nirodha<span class='add'>‘s care</span><br>
than life in <span class='add'>the care of</span> Sākhā.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5828'></a> Instructed by that advice of the deer<span class='add'>-king</span>,<br>
my mother and I, because of his advice,<br>
to the delightful Tusitā heaven came<br>
as though <span class='add'>we</span> had gone abroad, taking <span class='add'>our</span> house. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18-19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5829'></a> Again, when Hero Kassapa’s<br>
dispensation had reached <span class='add'>its</span> goal,<br>
ascending to a mountain-top<br>
engaged in the Victor’s teachings, <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5830'></a> now, in Rājagaha <span class='add'>city</span>,<br>
I was born in a wealthy clan.<br>
My mother, with <span class='add'>me in her</span> womb,<br>
had gone forth into homelessness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5831'></a> Finding out that <span class='add'>she</span> was pregnant,<br>
they approached Devadatta then.<br>
He said, “let all of you banish<br>
this Buddhist nun who is evil.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5832'></a> Now <span class='add'>she</span> too being shown mercy<br>
by the Lord of Sages, Victor,<br>
my mother’s <span class='add'>living</span> happily<br>
in a convent for Buddhist nuns. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5833'></a> Finding that out, the Kosala<br>
earth-protector supported me,<br>
with the care given to a prince,<br>
and by name I was “Kassapa.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5834-5835'></a> Because there was “Great Kassapa,”<br>
I <span class='add'>was known as</span> “Boy Kassapa.”<br>
Hearing Buddha’s preaching that the<br>
body’s the same as an anthill,<br>
because of that my mind was freed<br>
from attachment altogether.<br>
After taming King Pāyāsi,<br>
I <span class='add'>then</span> attained that foremost place. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25-26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5836'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5837'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5838'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
