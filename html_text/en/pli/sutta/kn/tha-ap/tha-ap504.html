<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5396'></a> In the city, Haṃsavatī,<br>
I was a potter <span class='add'>at that time</span>.<br>
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,<br>
the Flood-Crosser, Undefiled One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5397'></a> I gave to <span class='add'>him,</span> the Best Buddha,<br>
a well-fashioned bowl made of clay.<br>
Giving <span class='add'>that</span> bowl to the Buddha,<br>
the Honest One, the Neutral One, <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5398'></a> being reborn in existence,<br>
I’m receiving plates made of gold,<br>
and flat bowls made of silver, gold,<br>
and also <span class='add'>some</span> made out of gems; <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5399'></a> I’m enjoying <span class='add'>all these</span> dishes:<br>
that is the fruit of good karma.<br>
I am <span class='add'>the owner of</span> bowls made<br>
for the famous and the wealthy. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5400-5401'></a> As with a seed which is planted,<br>
in a field which is bountiful:<br>
when it rains, with proper support,<br>
fruit pleases the cultivator;<br>
so too is this bowl-donation,<br>
<span class='add'>well-</span>planted in the Buddha-field:<br>
when it rains the joy-bringing <span class='add'>rain,</span><br>
the fruit will be pleasing to me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5-6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5402'></a> As far as <span class='add'>merit-</span>fields exist—<br>
even the Assemblies and groups—<br>
the Buddha-field has no equal,<br>
giving <span class='add'>great</span> happiness to all. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5403'></a> Praise to you, O Well-Bred Person!<br>
Praise to you, Ultimate Person!<br>
After giving a single bowl,<br>
I’ve attained the unshaking state. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5404'></a> In the ninety-one aeons since<br>
I gave <span class='add'>him</span> that bowl at that time,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5405'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5406'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5407'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
