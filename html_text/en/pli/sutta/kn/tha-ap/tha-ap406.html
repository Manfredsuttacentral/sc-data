<p><a class='jw' id='jw3962'></a> The River named Bhāgīrathī<br>
is fed by the Himalayas.<br>
It is always flowing along,<br>
past the gate of Haṃsavatī. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3963'></a> The hermitage named Sobhita,<br>
well-built, is on the river’s slopes.<br>
The Buddha, Padumuttara,<br>
the World’s Leader, was dwelling there. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3964'></a> He was honored the people,<br>
like Indra by the thirty <span class='add'>gods</span>.<br>
The Blessed One was seated there<br>
fearlessly <span class='add'>just</span> like a lion. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3965'></a> I was a brahmin living in<br>
the city of Haṃsavatī.<br>
My name <span class='add'>back then</span> was Chalaṇga,<br>
named thus <span class='add'>because</span> I was a sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3966'></a> One thousand eight hundred students<br>
were surrounding me at that time.<br>
Joined together with those students,<br>
I went up to the riverbank. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3967'></a> At that place I saw <span class='add'>Buddhist</span> monks,<br>
without deceit, cleansed of evil,<br>
crossing Bhāgīrathī <span class='add'>River</span>.<br>
At that time I reflected thus: <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3968'></a> “These sons of Buddha, of great fame,<br>
are crossing evening and morning;<br>
they are being troubled themselves,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> their things are getting ruined. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3969'></a> The Buddha’s said to be the Chief<br>
of the world including the gods.<br>
I have not <span class='add'>yet</span> made donations<br>
that would cleanse <span class='add'>my</span> road to rebirth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3970'></a> Why then don’t I get a bridge built<br>
on the river for Best Buddha?<br>
Causing that work to be done, I’ll<br>
transmigrate in this existence.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3971'></a> Donating a hundred thousand<br>
I had a bridge built <span class='add'>for him there</span>,<br>
trusting that “doing this deed will<br>
be of great <span class='add'>advantage</span> to me.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3972'></a> Having caused <span class='add'>that</span> bridge to be built,<br>
I went up to the World-Leader.<br>
Hands pressed together on <span class='add'>my</span> head,<br>
I spoke these words <span class='add'>to him back then</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3973'></a> “Donating one hundred thousand,<br>
I’ve caused this magnificent bridge<br>
to be constructed for your sake;<br>
please accept <span class='add'>it</span>, O Sage So Great.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3974'></a> Padumuttara, World-Knower,<br>
Sacrificial Recipient,<br>
seated in the monks’ Assembly,<br>
spoke these verses <span class='add'>about me then</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3975'></a> “He who had <span class='add'>this</span> bridge built for me,<br>
<span class='add'>feeling well-</span>pleased by <span class='add'>his</span> own hands,<br>
I shall relate details of him;<br>
<span class='add'>all of</span> you listen to my words: <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3976'></a> Fallen into a cave or from<br>
<span class='add'>the top of</span> a mountain or tree,<br>
even dying he will get caught:<br>
that’s the fruit of giving bridges. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3977'></a> As the wind <span class='add'>does not disturb</span> a<br>
banyan spreading <span class='add'>its</span> growing roots,<br>
enemies will not defeat <span class='add'>him</span>:<br>
that’s the fruit of giving bridges. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3978'></a> No thieves are going to defeat him<br>
and the king will not despise <span class='add'>him</span>.<br>
He’ll surpass all <span class='add'>his</span> enemies:<br>
that’s the fruit of giving bridges. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3979'></a> <span class='add'>Even</span> in an unsheltered space,<br>
being scorched by the <span class='add'>sun’s</span> harsh heat,<br>
conforming with <span class='add'>his</span> good karma,<br>
he won’t feel any discomfort. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3980'></a> In the world of gods or of men,<br>
a well-built elephant-carriage<br>
all of the time will come to be,<br>
discerning what he is thinking. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3981'></a> A thousand fast carriages with<br>
Sindh horses as quick as the wind<br>
will come to <span class='add'>him</span> evening and morning:<br>
that’s the fruit of giving bridges. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3982'></a> Having come to the human state,<br>
this one is going to be happy;<br>
here too for <span class='add'>this</span> very man the<br>
elephant-carriage will appear. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3983'></a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3984'></a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
knowing well all the defilements<br>
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3985'></a> O! that karma well-done by me<br>
for him whose name is “Best Lotus.”<br>
Having done that deed <span class='add'>for him</span> there,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3986'></a> Having put forth exertion, I’m<br>
calmed, devoid of grounds for rebirth;<br>
like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3988'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
All defilements are exhausted;<br>
now there will be no more rebirth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3987'></a>Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3989'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
