<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1'></a> The Sage of Vedeha, his body bent, asked<br>
the Thus-Gone-One dwelling in Jetavana,<br>
“Indeed there are those <span class='add'>called</span> Omniscient Buddhas;<br>
through what causes do they become <span class='add'>so</span>, Hero?”</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2'></a> Then spoke the Omniscient, Outstanding, Great Sage,<br>
to lucky Ānanda with <span class='add'>his</span> honeyed voice,<br>
“Who performed service among former Buddhas,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> didn’t get freed in their dispensations,</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3'></a> because that is the means to awaken, wise,<br>
they with sharp knowing, through knowledge and power,<br>
because of <span class='add'>their</span> wishes <span class='add'>and</span> also great strength,<br>
do come to attain that state of omniscience.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4'></a> I too among former Buddhas<br>
did wish to become a Buddha.<br>
Through <span class='add'>my</span> mind alone there were<br>
innumerable <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-kings.”</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5'></a> <span class='add'>Now</span> listen, with purified minds,<br>
to the legends of the Buddhas,<br>
innumerable <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-kings<br>
who fulfilled thirty perfections. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6'></a> I worshipped them <span class='add'>bowing</span> my head,<br>
having praised with ten fingers pressed,<br>
those World-Chiefs with followers <span class='add'>and</span><br>
the Best Buddhas’ Awakening. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw7'></a> I brought it all forth with my mind:<br>
things on the ground and in the sky,<br>
uncountable as are the gems<br>
found in the fields of the Buddhas. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw8'></a> I created a palace there,<br>
with a floor made out of silver.<br>
Various floors made out of gems<br>
arose and stretched up toward the sky. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw9'></a> There were varied well-made pillars,<br>
well-proportioned, very costly.<br>
The central beam was made of gold,<br>
the gate was canopy-adorned. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw10'></a> The first floor, lapis lazuli,<br>
was lovely as a stainless cloud.<br>
Lotus ponds were scattered about<br>
on a floor made of superb gold. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw11'></a> A coral <span class='add'>floor</span>, coral-colored,<br>
was red and <span class='add'>very</span> beautiful;<br>
<span class='add'>that</span> floor lit up the directions<br>
with light the hue of red beetles. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw12'></a> Doors and windows and turrets <span class='add'>too</span>,<br>
and four railings were well-laid-out.<br>
It had a scented bamboo net<br>
which was delightful to the mind. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw13'></a> There were excellent gabled roofs<br>
<span class='add'>colored</span> blue <span class='add'>and</span> yellow <span class='add'>and</span> red,<br>
white <span class='add'>and also</span> mixed black-and-white,<br>
adorned with the seven gemstones. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw14'></a> Lovely <span class='add'>pictures of</span> birds and beasts<br>
and lotuses fashioned for looks;<br>
it was adorned with moon and sun,<br>
dotted with star-constellations. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw15'></a> It was covered with a gold net<br>
furnished with little golden bells.<br>
Those gold garlands sang in the force<br>
of the wind, delighting the mind. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw16'></a> A garland of flags was hoisted,<br>
dyed in a spectrum of colors:<br>
some light crimson, others deep red,<br>
tawny, yellow and yellowish. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw17'></a> Numerous various hundreds<br>
of slabs were made out of silver,<br>
made of crystal, made of ruby,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> likewise made out of cat’s eye. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw17e-f'></a><a class='jw' id='jw18'></a> Various diverse couches were<br>
spread with soft Benares muslin,<br>
rugs, fine silk, and cloth from China,<br>
fibrous cloth and yellow garments.<br>
All of these various carpets<br>
I laid out <span class='add'>on them</span> with my mind. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw19'></a> On this floor and that <span class='add'>floor</span> too,<br>
ornamented with huts of gems,<br>
effulgent torches <span class='add'>made of</span> gems<br>
are being carried and fixed well. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw20'></a> Columns <span class='add'>and</span> pillars are splendid,<br>
and beautiful golden gateways<br>
made of special gold and hard woods,<br>
and also made out of silver. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw21'></a> Varied windows, well-proportioned;<br>
painted cross-bars <span class='add'>adorned</span> the doors,<br>
with “pots of plenty” on both sides,<br>
filled with lotuses and lilies. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw22'></a> I conjured up all past Buddhas,<br>
World-Leaders, <span class='add'>their</span> Assemblies too,<br>
with their natural complexions<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> forms, and <span class='add'>all</span> their followers. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw23'></a> Having entered through the doorway<br>
all the Buddhas and followers<br>
sat down on chairs all made of gold<br>
<span class='add'>and formed</span> an exalted circle. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw24'></a> Those Buddhas who live here-and-now,<br>
who have no rivals in the world,<br>
and those who lived in former times:<br>
I brought them all into the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw25'></a> Lonely Buddhas, many hundreds,<br>
Self-dependent, Unconquered Ones,<br>
and those who lived in former times:<br>
I brought them all into the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw26'></a> There are many wishing-trees there<br>
who are both human and divine.<br>
Having arranged all of the cloth<br>
I give them <span class='add'>each</span> the triple robe. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw27'></a> Filling lovely bowls made of gems<br>
I then provided <span class='add'>alms</span> to them:<br>
foods that were soft, <span class='add'>and</span> hard foods <span class='add'>too</span>,<br>
well-prepared food and drink to taste. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw28'></a><a class='jw' id='jw29a-b'></a> Being given burnished-cloth robes<br>
which were <span class='add'>just like</span> divine garments,<br>
honey and crystallized sugar,<br>
sesame oil <span class='add'>and</span> sugar-cane juice,<br>
with milk-rice, each one satisfied,<br>
<span class='add'>they formed</span> an exalted circle. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw29c-d'></a><a class='jw' id='jw30a-b'></a> Having entered a jeweled room<br>
like a lion its secret cave,<br>
they got onto priceless couches<br>
in the sleeping-lion posture. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw30c-f'></a> Mindfully rising up they <span class='add'>then</span><br>
sat cross-legged on those couches,<br>
filled with delight in altered states,<br>
the pasturage of all Buddhas. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw31'></a>Some are preaching their doctrines <span class='add'>then</span>,<br>
<span class='add'>while</span> others sport in miracles.<br>
Others apply special knowledges,<br>
masters of special knowledges.<br>
Various lakhs of others still<br>
transform into various shapes. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw32'></a> Buddhas are questioning Buddhas<br>
about the range of omniscience.<br>
Understanding deep, abstruse points,<br>
they achieve their Awakenings. <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw33'></a> Followers questioning Buddhas;<br>
Buddhas questioning followers.<br>
Questioning one another they<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> provide each other answers. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw34'></a> Buddhas and Lonely Buddhas <span class='add'>too,</span><br>
followers and the attendants,<br>
thus delighting in devotions,<br>
are really enjoying the palace. <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw35'></a> Let there be carried over head<br>
a pearl-net-draped umbrella,<br>
combined with <span class='add'>more</span> nets made of gold<br>
and also of silver and gems. <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw36'></a> Let there be awnings made of cloth,<br>
decorated with golden stars<br>
and with diverse garlands spread out;<br>
let all be carried over head. <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw37'></a> They are spread out with floral wreaths,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> beautified with scented wreaths;<br>
studded with wreaths made out of cloth<br>
decorated with wreaths of gems. <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw38'></a> They are strewn with varied flowers,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> scented with fragrant perfumes,<br>
marked with special scented palm-prints,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> covered with golden covers. <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw39'></a> Let lotus-ponds in four directions,<br>
full of lotuses and lilies,<br>
appear like they were formed of gold,<br>
exuding dusty lotus-pollen. <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw40'></a> Let all the trees that are around<br>
the palace burst forth into bloom.<br>
And in the evening let those flowers<br>
release sweet scents, sprinkling the realm. <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw41'></a> Let peacocks there begin to dance<br>
to the songs of heavenly swans,<br>
and let cuckoos make melodies:<br>
on all sides <span class='add'>there’s</span> a choir of birds. <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw42'></a> Let all the drums <span class='add'>now</span> be sounded;<br>
let all the stringed instruments wail.<br>
Let all the choruses commence<br>
on every side of the palace. <a class='vjw' id='vjw38'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw43-44'></a> Let there be couches made of gold —<br>
very large, endowed with brightness,<br>
without blemish, fashioned with gems —<br>
throughout the field of the Buddhas,<br>
and in the universe beyond.<br>
Let the stands of lamps be lighted;<br>
let a series of ten thousand<br>
all burn as though one single flame. <a class='vjw' id='vjw39-40'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw45'></a> Let courtesans and dancers dance,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> troupes of celestial nymphs.<br>
Let them put on various shows<br>
on all the sides of the palace. <a class='vjw' id='vjw41'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw46'></a> On tree top or mountain top<br>
or the crest of Mount Sineru,<br>
I am raising up all the flags,<br>
decorated <span class='add'>and</span> five-colored. <a class='vjw' id='vjw42'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw47'></a> Let people, snake-gods, music-nymphs<br>
and all the gods come forth <span class='add'>as well</span>;<br>
in homage, hands pressed together,<br>
they attended on the palace. <a class='vjw' id='vjw43'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw48'></a> Whatever is wholesome karma,<br>
which deeds were to be done by me,<br>
with body, speech and with my mind,<br>
<span class='add'>I</span> did them well <span class='add'>to reach</span> heaven. <a class='vjw' id='vjw44'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw49'></a> Whichever beings have consciousness<br>
and also those who aren’t conscious,<br>
let every one of them receive<br>
the fruit of merit done by me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw45'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw50'></a> That which I did was widely known;<br>
I gave away that good deed’s fruit<br>
and gods went off to make it known<br>
to <span class='add'>all</span> those who were unaware. <a class='vjw' id='vjw46'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw51'></a> Let all the beings in all worlds<br>
whose lives depend on eating food<br>
receive by means of my own mind<br>
all appetizing things to eat! <a class='vjw' id='vjw47'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw52'></a> With my mind these alms were given,<br>
with my mind the palace was built,<br>
and likewise so were worshipped all<br>
the Buddhas, Lonelies and followers. <a class='vjw' id='vjw48'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw53'></a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw49'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw54'></a> I witness two kinds of rebirth,<br>
as a human and as a god.<br>
I do not witness other states:<br>
that’s the fruit of mental wishes. <a class='vjw' id='vjw50'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw55'></a> Among the gods I am the chief;<br>
I am the ruler among men.<br>
Endowed with beauty and <span class='add'>good</span> marks,<br>
in knowledge unrivaled <span class='add'>each</span> birth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw51'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw56'></a> Savory foods of different types<br>
and fabulous precious gemstones,<br>
likewise clothes of various sorts<br>
quickly come to me from the sky. <a class='vjw' id='vjw52'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw57'></a> On flat earth, so on a mountain,<br>
in the air, in water or woods,<br>
whenever I stretch out my hand,<br>
divine foods are coming to me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw53'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw58'></a> On flat earth, so on a mountain,<br>
in the air, in water or woods,<br>
whenever I stretch out my hand,<br>
all gemstones are coming to me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw54'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw59'></a> On flat earth, so on a mountain,<br>
in the air, in water or woods,<br>
whenever I stretch out my hand,<br>
all perfumes are coming to me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw55'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw60'></a> On flat earth, so on a mountain,<br>
in the air, in water or woods,<br>
whenever I stretch out my hand,<br>
all vehicles <span class='add'>then</span> come to me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw56'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw61'></a> On flat earth, so on a mountain,<br>
in the air, in water or woods,<br>
whenever I stretch out my hand,<br>
all garlands are coming to me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw57'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw62'></a> On flat earth, so on a mountain,<br>
in the air, in water or woods,<br>
whenever I stretch out my hand,<br>
all ornaments <span class='add'>then</span> come to me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw58'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw63'></a> On flat earth, so on a mountain,<br>
in the air, in water or woods,<br>
whenever I stretch out my hand,<br>
all maidens are coming to me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw59'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw64'></a> On flat earth, so on a mountain,<br>
in the air, in water or woods,<br>
whenever I stretch out my hand,<br>
granulated sugar comes to me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw60'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw65'></a> On flat earth, so on a mountain,<br>
in the air, in water or woods,<br>
whenever I stretch out my hand,<br>
all solid foodstuffs come to me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw61'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw66'></a> To attain supreme Awakening<br>
I gave <span class='add'>many</span> excellent gifts<br>
to the poor and to the gypsies,<br>
to beggars and to travelers. <a class='vjw' id='vjw62'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw67'></a> Making the rocky mountains shout<br>
and <span class='add'>likewise</span> making dense hills roar,<br>
making the world with <span class='add'>its</span> gods smile,<br>
I become Buddha in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw63'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw68'></a> There’s no end to going about<br>
in the world in ten directions.<br>
And in this quarter of the world<br>
the Buddha-fields can’t be counted. <a class='vjw' id='vjw64'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw69'></a> My two-fold raying miracle<br>
is splendid and <span class='add'>very</span> well-known.<br>
Therein a net of flames <span class='add'>appears</span><br>
and vast effulgence is produced. <a class='vjw' id='vjw65'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw70'></a> In so many universes<br>
let all the people see me <span class='add'>there</span>.<br>
Let them all be made <span class='add'>most</span> happy<br>
and follow me as their model. <a class='vjw' id='vjw66'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw71'></a> Beat the drum of deathlessness<br>
with its sweet <span class='add'>and</span> distinguished sound.<br>
Let all the people in that space<br>
listen <span class='add'>well</span> to the honeyed song. <a class='vjw' id='vjw67'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw72'></a> May all of them be undefiled<br>
on whom the cloud of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i> rains;<br>
let even lowly beings there<br>
become those who enter the stream. <a class='vjw' id='vjw68'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw73'></a> I gave the gifts that should be given,<br>
fully fulfilling the precepts.<br>
Going into perfect disgust,<br>
supreme Awakening’s attained. <a class='vjw' id='vjw69'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw74'></a> Having inquired of the learned,<br>
having made extreme exertion,<br>
going into perfect patience,<br>
supreme Awakening’s attained. <a class='vjw' id='vjw70'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw75'></a> Strengthening my resolution,<br>
I fulfilled the truth-perfection.<br>
Going into perfect loving,<br>
supreme Awakening’s attained. <a class='vjw' id='vjw71'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw76'></a> In getting and in not getting<br>
in pain or pleasure, scorn or fame,<br>
remaining everywhere the same<br>
supreme Awakening’s attained. <a class='vjw' id='vjw72'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw77'></a> Looking at laziness with fear,<br>
and with love upon exertion,<br>
be those exerting selves with faith;<br>
that’s the advice of the Buddhas. <a class='vjw' id='vjw73'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw78'></a> Looking at quarrels full of fear<br>
and with love upon agreement,<br>
join together in harmony;<br>
that’s the advice of the Buddhas. <a class='vjw' id='vjw74'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw79'></a> Looking at carelessness with fear<br>
and with love upon attention,<br>
<span class='add'>now</span> cultivate the Eight-fold Path;<br>
that’s the advice of the Buddhas. <a class='vjw' id='vjw75'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw80'></a> Many Buddhas come together<br>
and also all the arahants.<br>
Pay homage while you’re worshipping<br>
the Buddhas and the arahants. <a class='vjw' id='vjw76'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw81'></a> Thus the Buddhas can’t be fathomed;<br>
unfathomable their Teaching.<br>
Unfathomable’s the result<br>
of pleasure in what can’t be fathomed. <a class='vjw' id='vjw77'></a></p>
