<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5987'></a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
the Sage, Knower of Every World,<br>
the One who had <span class='add'>Five</span> Eyes, arose<br>
a hundred thousand aeons hence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5988'></a>The Admonisher, Instructor,<br>
Crosser-Over of all that breathe,<br>
Skilled at Preaching, <span class='add'>he</span>, the Buddha,<br>
caused many folks to cross <span class='add'>the flood</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5989'></a> Merciful, Compassionate One,<br>
Well-Wisher of all that breathe, he<br>
established in the five precepts<br>
all the rivals who had arrived. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5990'></a> In this way he was Unconfused<br>
and Very Well-Known by rivals,<br>
Ornamented by arahants<br>
who were masters <span class='add'>and</span> neutral ones. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5991'></a> The <span class='add'>body of the</span> Sage So Great<br>
rose up fifty-eight cubits <span class='add'>tall</span>;<br>
he was Valuable Like Gold,<br>
Bearing the Thirty-Two Great Marks. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5992'></a> <span class='add'>People’s</span> lifespan at that time was<br>
<span class='add'>fully</span> one hundred thousand years.<br>
Remaining <span class='add'>in the world</span> so long,<br>
he ferried many folks across. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5993'></a> I was then in Haṃsavatī;<br>
I was <span class='add'>born</span> in a certain clan.<br>
Bound to working for others, I<br>
did not have any possessions. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5994'></a> Living on the unfinished floor<br>
of a storeroom for special seats,<br>
I lit a fire there <span class='add'>on that floor</span>;<br>
the earth became hard <span class='add'>and</span> blackened. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5995'></a> Then the Lord, explaining the Four<br>
Noble Truths to the retinue,<br>
lavished praise on a follower<br>
who wore inferior cloth robes. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5996'></a> <span class='add'>Then</span> thrilled at that virtue of his,<br>
falling before the Thus-Gone-One,<br>
I aspired to that supreme place,<br>
foremost among those with rough robes. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5997-5998'></a> Then Buddha Padumuttara<br>
said this to <span class='add'>all his</span> followers:<br>
“All of you look at that person,<br>
with bad clothes, a skinny body,<br>
with joy <span class='add'>and</span> pleasure in <span class='add'>his</span> face,<br>
possessing a great wealth of faith,<br>
happy, body hair grown upward,<br>
steadfast, eating food in a hall. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11-12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5999'></a> He’s wishing to <span class='add'>attain</span> the place<br>
of <span class='add'>this</span> monk <span class='add'>named</span> Saccasena;<br>
his hope’s for the appearance of<br>
this <span class='add'>monk</span> wearing robes of rough cloth.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6000-6001'></a> After hearing that, being thrilled,<br>
bowing <span class='add'>my</span> head to the Victor,<br>
doing good karma my whole life<br>
in the Victor’s dispensation,<br>
due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I was gone to Tāvatiṃsa. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14-15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6002'></a> Through the deed of burning the floor<br>
in the storeroom for special seats,<br>
for all of a thousand <span class='add'>years,</span> I<br>
burned in hell, remaining in pain. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6003'></a> Due to that karma’s remainder,<br>
I had five hundred <span class='add'>more</span> rebirths,<br>
being born in a human clan,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> marked with the marks of <span class='add'>my</span> caste. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6004'></a> For those same five hundred rebirths,<br>
I’m afflicted with skin disease,<br>
I underwent great suffering,<br>
through the power of that karma. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6005'></a> In this <span class='add'>present</span> lucky aeon,<br>
having a mind <span class='add'>full</span> of pleasure,<br>
I entertained with begged alms food<br>
Upariṭṭha, the Famous One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6006'></a> Through the rest of the deed I did,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6007'></a> When <span class='add'>my</span> last rebirth was attained,<br>
I’m born in a warrior clan.<br>
After the death of my father,<br>
I possessed a large kingdom <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6009'></a> Afflicted with a skin disease,<br>
I get no comfort in the night.<br>
Due to useless royal comfort,<br>
I was then called “King of Useless.”<br>
Seeing the flaws of the body,<br>
I went forth into homelessness.<br>
I entered in the studentship<br>
of Bāvarī, the chief brahmin. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6010'></a> With an enormous retinue,<br>
approaching the Leader of Men,<br>
I asked a subtle question of<br>
the Hero, Debater-Crusher. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6011'></a> “<span class='add'>In</span> this world <span class='add'>or in</span> the next world<br>
<span class='add'>or</span> in Brahma’s world with <span class='add'>its</span> gods,<br>
<span class='add'>might</span> he not know the sight of you,<br>
of Gotama, the Famous One? <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6012'></a> Thus one with excellent knowledge<br>
comes to the point through the question,<br>
<span class='add'>while</span> looking upon what world, <span class='add'>then</span>,<br>
does the King of Death not see <span class='add'>him</span>?” <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6013-6014'></a> The Physician for all Disease,<br>
the Buddha answered <span class='add'>this</span> to me:<br>
“Look upon the world as empty,<br>
Mogharāja; always mindful,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> uprooting his own <span class='add'>false</span> views,<br>
<span class='add'>in this way</span> he’d cross beyond death.<br>
Thusly looking upon the world,<br>
the King of Death does not see <span class='add'>him</span>.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw27-28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6015'></a> And the conclusion of that verse,<br>
cutting off <span class='add'>my</span> hair and <span class='add'>my</span> beard,<br>
putting on saffron-colored robes,<br>
I became an arahant monk. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6016'></a> Oppressed by illness I don’t live<br>
in Assembly monasteries.<br>
“Don’t offend the monastery”—<br>
by that word I’m extra-oppressed. <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6017'></a> Taking <span class='add'>cloth</span> atop rubbish heaps,<br>
from charnel field, on carriage roads,<br>
having made <span class='add'>my</span> robe out of that,<br>
I am wearing a rough-cloth robe. <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6018'></a> Pleased about that virtue of mine,<br>
the Great Physician, the Leader,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> placed me in the foremost place<br>
of those who wear robes of rough cloth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6019'></a> Merit and evil are all destroyed;<br>
every illness is driven out.<br>
Like fire, <span class='add'>I</span> have no attachments;<br>
I will realize nirvana. <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6020'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6021'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6022'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
