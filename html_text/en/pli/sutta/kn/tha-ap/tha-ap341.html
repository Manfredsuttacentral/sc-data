<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3042'></a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
was the Master of Everything.<br>
<span class='add'>While</span> preaching the Four Noble Truths,<br>
he ferried many folks across. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3043'></a> A matted-haired ascetic then,<br>
I practiced fierce austerities.<br>
Throwing off <span class='add'>my</span> clothes made of bark,<br>
I traveled in the sky back then. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3044'></a> Then I was unable to fly<br>
over <span class='add'>him</span>, the Best of Buddhas.<br>
Like a bird hitting a mountain,<br>
I did not get to journey on. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3045'></a> My movement had not formerly<br>
been obstructed in such a way;<br>
as though rising up from water,<br>
I easily flew through the sky. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3046'></a> “A lofty human being must<br>
be sitting underneath <span class='add'>me now</span>.<br>
It’s good for me to search for him;<br>
I might obtain something worthwhile.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3047'></a> Then descending from the sky, I<br>
heard the sound of the Teacher,<br>
who was preaching impermanence;<br>
I learned that <span class='add'>lesson</span> at that time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3048'></a> Learning to see impermanence<br>
I went back to my hermitage.<br>
Dwelling there the rest of my life,<br>
I passed away <span class='add'>right</span> on the spot. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3049'></a> In <span class='add'>my</span> subsequent existence,<br>
I recalled hearing that Teaching.<br>
Due to that karma done very well,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3050'></a> For thirty thousand aeons I<br>
delighted in the world of gods.<br>
And I exercised divine rule,<br>
one more than fifty <span class='add'>different</span> times. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3051'></a> And seventy-one <span class='add'>different</span> times<br>
I was a wheel-turning monarch.<br>
There was <span class='add'>also</span> much local rule,<br>
innumerable by counting. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3052'></a> <span class='add'>Then</span> seated in my father’s house,<br>
a monk with senses <span class='add'>well-</span>controlled,<br>
illustrating <span class='add'>the truth</span> in verse,<br>
spoke of things as impermanent. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3053'></a> Remembering that perception,<br>
transmigrating from birth to birth,<br>
I <span class='add'>still</span> did not perceive the end,<br>
nirvana, everlasting state. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3054'></a> “In flux indeed is all that is;<br>
things come to be <span class='add'>and then</span> decay.<br>
They arise <span class='add'>and then</span> they dissolve;<br>
their cessation is happiness.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3055'></a> After hearing <span class='add'>him say</span> that verse,<br>
I recalled my past perception.<br>
Seated in a single sitting,<br>
I achieved the arahant-state. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3056'></a> Being <span class='add'>only</span> seven years old,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship.<br>
Recognizing <span class='add'>my</span> virtue the<br>
Buddha, Eyeful One ordained me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3057'></a> Even though I was a <span class='add'>mere</span> boy,<br>
I finished what needs to be done.<br>
Today what do I need to do<br>
in the Śākyan’s dispensation? <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3058'></a> In the hundred thousand aeons<br>
since I did that <span class='add'>good</span> karma then,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
the fruit in hearing the Teaching. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3059'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>

<p>Thus indeed Venerable Dhammasavaniya Thera spoke these verses.</p>
