<p><a class='jw' id='jw1696'></a> The battle between both god-kings<br>
<span class='add'>had by then</span> come into being.<br>
A huge crowd was <span class='add'>gathered for it</span>,<br>
making a very loud racket. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1697'></a> Padumuttara, World-Knower,<br>
Sacrificial Recipient,<br>
the Teacher, standing in the sky,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> made many people feel moved. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1698'></a> All of the gods were delighted;<br>
<span class='add'>their</span> weapons and mail were thrown down.<br>
Having worshipped the Sambuddha<br>
they then stood off to one side <span class='add'>there</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1699'></a> Discerning what we were thinking,<br>
the Compassionate, World-Knower,<br>
uttered majestic words <span class='add'>just then,</span><br>
bringing many to nirvana. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1700'></a> “One man with evil in <span class='add'>his</span> heart<br>
might harm a single living being.<br>
Because of that stain on <span class='add'>his</span> heart<br>
he will be reborn in <span class='add'>some</span> hell. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1701'></a> An elephant on the battle front<br>
might harm so many living beings,<br>
<span class='add'>but if</span> he cools off <span class='add'>his</span> own heart<br>
he won’t be killed repeatedly.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1702'></a> <span class='add'>Both</span> of the armies of those two<br>
spirit-kings were <span class='add'>then</span> astonished.<br>
And they went to the World’s Best One,<br>
the Neutral One, <span class='add'>to take</span> refuge. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1703'></a> After <span class='add'>he’d</span> convinced the people,<br>
the Eyeful One <span class='add'>then</span> rose upwards,<br>
and being seen by <span class='add'>all</span> the gods,<br>
he departed, facing the north. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1704'></a> I was first to go for refuge<br>
to the Biped-Lord, Neutral One.<br>
For one hundred thousand aeons<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1705'></a> In the thirty thousandth aeon<br>
there were sixteen chariot-bulls,<br>
kings who turned the wheel <span class='add'>of the Law</span>,<br>
<span class='add'>all were</span> named Mahādundubhi. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1706'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>

<p>Thus indeed Venerable Saraṇāgamaniya Thera spoke these verses.</p>
