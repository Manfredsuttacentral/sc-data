<p><a class='jw' id='jw708'></a> The Victor Padumuttara,<br>
Sacrificial Recipient,<br>
leaving the group <span class='add'>of followers,</span><br>
dwelt in the Himalayas then. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw709'></a> I too was in Himalaya,<br>
dwelling in an ashram back then.<br>
I went up to the World-Leader,<br>
the Great Hero, who’d just arrived. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw710'></a> Taking a floral umbrella,<br>
I went up to the Bull of Men<br>
practicing <span class='add'>his</span> meditation;<br>
I caused <span class='add'>him</span> no interruption. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw711'></a> Holding it up with both my hands<br>
I gave the floral umbrella.<br>
Padumuttara the Great Sage,<br>
the Blessed One <span class='add'>then</span> received it. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw712'></a> All the gods, who were delighted,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> approached the Himalayas.<br>
They let out their cheers of “Sādhu,”<br>
“the Eyeful One will give <span class='add'>him</span> thanks.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw713'></a> After saying this <span class='add'>then</span> those gods<br>
approached <span class='add'>him</span>, the Best among Men.<br>
They were carrying in the sky<br>
his superb lotus-umbrella. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw714'></a> “Hoisting a lotus-umbrella,<br>
this ascetic gave it to me.<br>
I shall relate details of him;<br>
<span class='add'>all of</span> you listen to my words: <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw715'></a> He will exercise divine rule<br>
for five and twenty <span class='add'>full</span> aeons.<br>
Thirty-four times he’s going to be<br>
a king who turns the wheel <span class='add'>of law</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw716'></a> In whichever womb he’s reborn,<br>
<span class='add'>whether</span> it’s human or divine,<br>
he’s going to carry that lotus<br>
arrayed out in the open air. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw717'></a> In one hundred thousands aeons<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw718'></a> When Buddha’s words have been proclaimed<br>
he will attain the human state.<br>
In the mind-created body<br>
he will be <span class='add'>ranked as</span> ultimate. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw719'></a> There will be a pair of brothers;<br>
they will both be known as Pantha.<br>
Enjoying the ultimate goal<br>
they’ll light up the dispensation.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw720'></a> I went forth into homelessness<br>
<span class='add'>but even after</span> eighteen years<br>
I’d not gained <span class='add'>any</span> distinction<br>
in the Śākyan dispensation. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw721'></a> I was in a dumb position;<br>
I was despised in the city.<br>
<span class='add'>Even my</span> brother dismissed me:<br>
“It’s <span class='add'>now</span> time for you to go home.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw722'></a> Being one who was <span class='add'>thus</span> dismissed,<br>
I stood there with my mind depressed,<br>
in the monastery’s storage room,<br>
desiring to be a true monk. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw723'></a> Then to that place the Teacher came<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> touching my head with his hand<br>
then taking me by <span class='add'>my own</span> hand<br>
he made me come inside again. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw724'></a> Teacher, with compassion for me,<br>
gave a cloth for wiping the feet.<br>
In this way he did purify <span class='add'>me</span><br>
as I stood off to one side. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw725'></a> Having taken him by the hands—<br>
he who was like a red lotus—<br>
right there my mind was liberated<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> I became an arahant. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw726'></a> In <span class='add'>my</span> mind-created bodies<br>
I attained thorough excellence.<br>
Knowing well all the defilements,<br>
without defilements I <span class='add'>now</span> live. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw727'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
