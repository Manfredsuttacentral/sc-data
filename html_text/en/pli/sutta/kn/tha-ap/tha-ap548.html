<p><a class='jw' id='jw6187'></a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
the One with Eyes for everything,<br>
the Leader <span class='add'>of the World,</span> arose<br>
a hundred thousand aeons hence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6188'></a> The Teacher, Best among Leaders,<br>
Victor, Knower of Right from Wrong,<br>
Grateful, Mindful of Benefits,<br>
urges on those at the crossing. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6189'></a> Home of Kindness, examining<br>
<span class='add'>things</span> with <span class='add'>his</span> omniscient knowledge,<br>
the Limitless Heap of Virtue<br>
is preaching <span class='add'>his</span> superb <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6190'></a> At one time he, the Great Hero,<br>
assembled with limitless folks,<br>
is preaching the honeyed <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
along with the Four <span class='add'>Noble</span> Truths. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6191'></a> Having heard the superb Teaching,<br>
pure in beginning, middle, end,<br>
there was <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-penetration<br>
for one hundred thousand beings. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6192'></a> At that time the earth sounded forth<br>
and the clouds <span class='add'>began their</span> growling;<br>
the gods, Brahmā, men <span class='add'>and</span> titans<br>
continued saying “Excellent!” <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6193'></a> “O! The Compassionate Teacher!<br>
O! Preaching of the great <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>!<br>
O! The Victor lifts up those sunk<br>
in the ocean of existence.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6194'></a> When Brahmā with the gods <span class='add'>and</span> men<br>
were thus stirred up with emotion,<br>
the Victor praised a follower,<br>
foremost of pleasers of the clans. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6195'></a> I then <span class='add'>lived</span> in Haṃsavatī,<br>
born in a clan of ministers.<br>
Comfortable and good-looking,<br>
I was rich, with abundant wealth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6196'></a> Having approached Swan Hermitage,<br>
worshipping him, the Thus-Gone-One,<br>
hearing <span class='add'>his</span> honey<span class='add'>-sweet</span> <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
having served the Neutral One, <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6197'></a><a class='jw' id='jw6198a-b'></a> bowing down before <span class='add'>his</span> feet, I<br>
spoke these words <span class='add'>to him at that time</span>:<br>
“O Sage, he who was praised by you,<br>
foremost of the pleasers of clans,<br>
I will be like him, O Hero,<br>
in a Buddha’s dispensation.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6198c-d'></a><a class='jw' id='jw6199'></a> Then the Great Compassionate One<br>
said to me as though sprinkling me<br>
with ambrosia, “Son, striving one,<br>
you’ll attain that beautiful <span class='add'>place</span>.<br>
Doing a deed for the Victor,<br>
how could it then be without fruit? <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6200'></a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6201'></a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
the one whose name is Udāyi<br>
will be the Teacher’s follower.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6202'></a> After hearing that I was thrilled,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> then for as long as <span class='add'>I</span> lived,<br>
loving-hearted, I served the Guide,<br>
the Victor, with the requisites. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6203'></a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6204'></a> And now in <span class='add'>my</span> final rebirth,<br>
in lovely Kapilavastu,<br>
I’m born in a minister’s clan,<br>
with Suddhodana as <span class='add'>our</span> king. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6205'></a> When in lovely Lumbini grove,<br>
Siddhartha, the Bull among Men,<br>
was born for the well-being and<br>
the happiness of every world, <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6206'></a> on that same day, I <span class='add'>too</span> was born,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> I grew up along with him,<br>
beloved, friendly, <span class='add'>and</span> held dear,<br>
confident <span class='add'>and</span> skilled in the law. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6207'></a> At the age of twenty-nine <span class='add'>years,</span><br>
departing <span class='add'>from there</span> he went forth.<br>
Contorting <span class='add'>himself</span> for six years,<br>
he <span class='add'>then</span> was the Buddha, the Guide. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6208'></a> Conquering Death <span class='add'>and</span> his army,<br>
casting out <span class='add'>all the</span> defilements,<br>
crossing the flood of existence,<br>
he <span class='add'>then</span> was Buddha in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6209'></a> Going to the <span class='add'>place</span> named Isi<br>
he instructed the group of five;<br>
then the Blessed One instructed<br>
<span class='add'>folks</span>, going, going here <span class='add'>and</span> there. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6210'></a> Instructing those who could be led,<br>
assisting <span class='add'>the world</span> with <span class='add'>its</span> gods,<br>
approaching Maṅgalā mountain,<br>
the Victor then dwelt <span class='add'>in that place</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6211'></a> Then sent by Suddhodana, the<br>
earth’s protector, going, seeing<br>
the Ten-Powered One, going forth,<br>
I <span class='add'>too</span> became an arahant. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6212'></a> Then asking <span class='add'>it of</span> the Great Sage,<br>
I brought <span class='add'>him back</span> to Kapila.<br>
Then having gone <span class='add'>back there</span> again<br>
I’m bringing the great clan pleasure. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6213'></a> The Victor, glad at that virtue,<br>
the Bull of People spoke to me.<br>
The Guide appointed me foremost<br>
among the pleasers of the clans. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6214'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6215'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6216'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
