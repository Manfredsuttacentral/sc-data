<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw728'></a> When the World-Leader Sumedha,<br>
the Best Person, reached nirvana,<br>
with a pleased heart <span class='add'>and</span> happy mind<br>
I did <i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i> to <span class='add'>his</span> stupa. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw729'></a> Gathering together there those<br>
whose defilements had been destroyed,<br>
special knowledges, superpowers,<br>
I gave the monks’ Assembly a meal. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw730'></a> At that time I <span class='add'>also</span> waited<br>
on Sumedha the Blessed One.<br>
He who was known as Sumedha<br>
then provided his thanks <span class='add'>to me</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw731'></a> Due to the pleasure in <span class='add'>my</span> heart<br>
I‘m born in a <span class='add'>divine</span> mansion.<br>
Eight-six thousand divine nymphs<br>
delighted me <span class='add'>in that mansion</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw732'></a> They submitted only to me,<br>
with every pleasure constantly.<br>
I surpassed <span class='add'>all</span> the other gods;<br>
that is the fruit of good karma. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw733'></a> In the twenty-fifth aeon <span class='add'>thence</span><br>
I was the king named Varuṇa.<br>
I was then a wheel-turning king<br>
endowed with extra special food. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw734'></a> They did not have to plant the seed<br>
nor did they need to yoke the plough;<br>
<span class='add'>all</span> the folks <span class='add'>were able</span> to feed<br>
on rice uncooked with firewood. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw735'></a> After reigning there <span class='add'>in that way</span><br>
I went back to the divine state.<br>
Then too in that same way for me<br>
success in food came into being. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw736'></a> No living being, friend or foe<br>
is doing any harm to me.<br>
I am beloved of them all;<br>
that is the fruit of good karma. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw737'></a> In the thirty thousand aeons<br>
since I provided that gift then,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth;<br>
that’s the fruit of scented ointment. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw738'></a> In this <span class='add'>present</span> lucky aeon<br>
one time I was the lord of men.<br>
I was a wheel-turning king <span class='add'>then</span><br>
of great majesty and power. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw739'></a> I established many people<br>
in the five moral precepts <span class='add'>then</span><br>
<span class='add'>and</span> made them achieve good rebirths;<br>
I was beloved of the gods. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw740'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
