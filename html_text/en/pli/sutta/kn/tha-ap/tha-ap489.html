<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5140'></a> On a Himalayan mountain,<br>
<span class='add'>I’m</span> Devala the ascetic.<br>
My meditation walkway there<br>
was made by non-human beings. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5141'></a> Bearing a weight of matted hair,<br>
carrying a water-pot then,<br>
searching for ultimate meaning,<br>
I departed from the forest. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5142'></a> Eighty-six thousand students <span class='add'>there,</span><br>
waited upon me at that time.<br>
Well-known together with their deeds,<br>
they are living in the forest. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5143'></a> Going out from the hermitage,<br>
I made a stupa out of sand.<br>
Assembling various flowers,<br>
I worshipped that stupa then. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5144'></a> Bringing pleasure to <span class='add'>my</span> heart there,<br>
I <span class='add'>re-</span>entered the hermitage.<br>
All <span class='add'>my</span> students, come together,<br>
questioned me <span class='add'>about</span> what that meant: <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5145'></a> “<span class='add'>All of</span> us would like to find out<br>
which deity you’re honoring<br>
<span class='add'>at that</span> stupa made out of sand:<br>
being asked, please tell <span class='add'>that</span> to us.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5146'></a> “The Eyeful Ones, Greatly Famed Ones,<br>
have no views <span class='add'>and</span> no magic spells;<br>
they’re the ones I am honoring,<br>
the Best Buddhas, Greatly Famed Ones.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5147'></a> “In what way are they Great Heroes,<br>
Omniscient Ones, Lords of the World?<br>
What do they look like? What conduct?<br>
In what way are they Greatly Famed?” <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5148'></a> “Buddhas have thirty-two great marks,<br>
and also forty <span class='add'>adult</span> teeth.<br>
Their eyes with heifer-eyelashes<br>
resemble wild licorice fruits. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5149'></a> And when those Buddhas are walking,<br>
they look but a plough’s length ahead.<br>
They do not have a person’s voice;<br>
their euphonic sound is not heard. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5150'></a> Also, when those Well-Gone-Ones walk,<br>
they lift up <span class='add'>one foot at a time</span>,<br>
<span class='add'>always</span> starting <span class='add'>with</span> the right foot:<br>
that is the nature of Buddhas. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5151'></a> And those Buddhas are not afraid,<br>
<span class='add'>just</span> like lions, the kings of beasts.<br>
They do not <span class='add'>ever</span> praise themselves,<br>
and don’t revile living beings. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5152'></a> They are free of pride and contempt,<br>
the same for all living beings.<br>
Buddhas <span class='add'>only</span> praise selflessly:<br>
that is the nature of Buddhas. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5153'></a> And <span class='add'>when</span> Buddhas are being born,<br>
they radiate light <span class='add'>from themselves</span>,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> in six <span class='add'>different</span> ways they cause<br>
this whole <span class='add'>bountiful</span> earth to quake. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5154'></a> And they are <span class='add'>able to</span> see hell,<br>
and hell is cooled off at that time.<br>
A massive cloud rains forth <span class='add'>as well</span>:<br>
that is the nature of Buddhas. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5155'></a> Such-like are those Great Elephants,<br>
Incomparable, of Great Fame;<br>
in beauty they are unsurpassed,<br>
the Thus-Gone-Ones, Beyond Measure.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5156'></a> All of <span class='add'>my</span> students, respectful,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> expressed <span class='add'>their</span> thanks for my speech,<br>
and likewise went along <span class='add'>with me,</span><br>
as far as they could <span class='add'>and</span> had strength. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5157'></a> Wishing for <span class='add'>their</span> own <span class='add'>good</span> karma,<br>
they’re worshipping <span class='add'>that</span> sand <span class='add'>stupa</span>.<br>
Having faith in that speech <span class='add'>of mine</span>,<br>
their minds drifted to Buddhahood. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5158'></a> Then a God’s Son, Greatly Famous,<br>
fell down from Tusitā heaven.<br>
He was born in a mother’s womb,<br>
making the ten-thousand <span class='add'>worlds</span> quake. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5159'></a> I stood on the walkway which was<br>
near <span class='add'>my</span> hermitage <span class='add'>at that time</span>.<br>
All <span class='add'>my</span> students, having gathered,<br>
came into my presence <span class='add'>just then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5160'></a> “The earth, bull-like, is bellowing;<br>
it’s roaring like the king of beasts.<br>
It’s shaking like a crocodile;<br>
what will this be the result of?” <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5161'></a> “The Buddha I detailed <span class='add'>for you,</span><br>
close to the stupa made of sand,<br>
the Blessed One, the Teacher, now<br>
has been born in a mother’s womb.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5162'></a> Discussing the Teaching for them,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> having detailed the Great Sage,<br>
exhorting <span class='add'>my</span> own students <span class='add'>there</span>,<br>
I sat in lotus position. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5163'></a> <span class='add'>All</span> my strength was <span class='add'>then</span> exhausted,<br>
due to a serious illness.<br>
Remembering the Best Buddha,<br>
I passed away <span class='add'>right</span> on the spot. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5164'></a> All <span class='add'>of my</span> students assembled;<br>
they made <span class='add'>me</span> a pyre at that time,<br>
and taking my mortal remains,<br>
they lifted <span class='add'>me</span> onto the pyre. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5165'></a> Having attended to the pyre,<br>
hands pressed together on <span class='add'>their</span> heads,<br>
wounded by the arrows of grief,<br>
come together they lamented. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5166'></a> While they were wailing <span class='add'>uselessly,</span><br>
I <span class='add'>then</span> came <span class='add'>back</span> to the pyre <span class='add'>there</span>.<br>
“I am your <span class='add'>dead</span> teacher, wise ones;<br>
do not lament <span class='add'>my passing on</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5167'></a> Endeavor for the highest good,<br>
night and day not being lazy.<br>
Don’t be negligent, all of you;<br>
your moment is offered to you.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5168'></a> Exhorting <span class='add'>my</span> own students <span class='add'>thus</span>,<br>
I returned to the world of gods.<br>
For eighteen aeons <span class='add'>after that</span><br>
I delighted in the gods’ world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5169'></a> And <span class='add'>then</span> a hundred times I was<br>
a king who turns the wheel <span class='add'>of law</span>.<br>
Also another hundred times,<br>
I was a king who turns the wheel.<br>
Also another hundred times<br>
I <span class='add'>then</span> exercised divine rule. <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5170'></a>In the remaining aeons I<br>
transmigrated as god or man.<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of generating. <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5171'></a> As in the month of Kattikā,<br>
many trees are in full flower,<br>
likewise in that very season,<br>
I have flowered as a great sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5172'></a> Vigorous effort’s the yoked ox,<br>
carrying perfect peace for me.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains<br>
I am dwelling without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5173'></a> In the hundred thousand aeons<br>
since I praised the Buddha <span class='add'>back then</span>,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of praising <span class='add'>Buddhas</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5174'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5175'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5176'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
