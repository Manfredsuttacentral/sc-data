<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw601'></a> Sambuddha Padumuttara<br>
was the Best in the World, the Guide.<br>
I saw him first, when he had <span class='add'>just</span><br>
achieved that state of Buddhahood. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw602'></a> All around the Bodhi tree’s roots<br>
spirits were gathered together<br>
surrounding the Sambuddha, they<br>
worshipped, with hands pressed together. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw603'></a> All the gods had delighted minds;<br>
as they flew around in the sky,<br>
“This one has become a Buddha,<br>
Dispelling the Darkness of Night.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw604'></a> A huge din was being produced<br>
by them overcome with laughter,<br>
“We’ll destroy our defilements<br>
in Sambuddha’s dispensation.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw605'></a> Having heard the words of the gods,<br>
that majestic speech they uttered,<br>
I gave <span class='add'>him</span> his very first food,<br>
happy, <span class='add'>and</span> with a happy heart. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw606'></a> Discerning what I was thinking,<br>
the Teacher, Peerless in the World,<br>
seated in the gods’ meeting hall<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> spoke these verses <span class='add'>about me</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw607'></a> “Leaving the world a week ago,<br>
today I reached Awakening.<br>
This one’s <span class='add'>given</span> me my first rice,<br>
a celibate monk’s sustenance. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw608'></a> I shall relate details of him<br>
who coming here from Tusitā<br>
presented this almsfood to me;<br>
<span class='add'>all of</span> you listen to my words: <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw609'></a> For thirty thousand aeons he<br>
will exercise divine rule.<br>
Overpowering all the gods<br>
he will reside in heaven <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw610'></a> Falling down from the world of gods<br>
he’ll go into a human state.<br>
A thousand times a wheel-turner<br>
he will reign there <span class='add'>for a long time</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw611'></a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw612'></a> Falling down from heaven <span class='add'>again</span><br>
he’ll go into a human state.<br>
Going forth from the house <span class='add'>and world</span><br>
he will dwell <span class='add'>there</span> for twenty years. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw613'></a> In the seventh year after that<br>
the Buddha will declare the truth.<br>
He whose name <span class='add'>will be</span> Koṇḍañña<br>
will be the first one to grasp <span class='add'>it</span>.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw614'></a> When <span class='add'>he</span> set out I <span class='add'>too</span> renounced<br>
and great effort was made by me.<br>
So as to destroy defilements<br>
I went forth into homelessness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw615'></a> Approaching, the Omniscient One,<br>
Buddha in the world with <span class='add'>its</span> gods<br>
did beat the drum of deathlessness<br>
in the deer-forest named “Isi”. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw616'></a> He has now achieved deathlessness,<br>
the unsurpassed and peaceful state.<br>
Knowing well all the defilements,<br>
without defilements I <span class='add'>now</span> live. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw617'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw618'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught!</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw619'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
