<p><a class='jw' id='jw5663'></a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
Lust-less, Unconquered Vanquisher,<br>
the Leader came into being,<br>
one hundred thousand aeons hence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5664'></a> The Hero, with Lotus-Leaf Eyes,<br>
with a Mouth as Pure as the Moon,<br>
Shining like a Mountain of Gold,<br>
Bright as the Sun when it’s Blazing, <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5665'></a> Transporting Beings’ Eyes <span class='add'>and</span> Minds,<br>
Adorned with the Excellent Marks,<br>
Traveled the Roads of All Sayings,<br>
Honored by People and the Gods, <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5666-5667'></a> Sambuddha, waking beings up,<br>
Eloquent One, Sweet-Sounding One,<br>
Compassion’s Continuous Nest,<br>
Confident among Multitudes,<br>
is preaching the sweet Teaching <span class='add'>there</span>,<br>
taking up the Four Noble Truths.<br>
He is lifting up those with breath,<br>
when they’re sunk in delusion’s muck. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4-5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5668'></a> Being an ascetic, alone,<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> home was Himalaya then.<br>
I saw the Victor, traveling<br>
the world of humans through the sky. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5669'></a> Having gone into his presence,<br>
I <span class='add'>then</span> heard <span class='add'>him</span> preaching <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i><br>
<span class='add'>and</span> praising the great virtue of<br>
one of that Hero’s followers: <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5670-5671'></a> “Whereby this <span class='add'>monk</span> Kaccāyana<br>
provides lengthy explanations<br>
of what’s been said by me in brief,<br>
he gladdens multitudes, and me.<br>
I see no other follower<br>
<span class='add'>or</span> anyone <span class='add'>preaching</span> this way.<br>
Thus he’s top, in that foremost place;<br>
so should you consider <span class='add'>him</span>, monks.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw8-9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5672-5673'></a> At that time, being astonished,<br>
having heard that lovely speaking,<br>
going to the Himalayas,<br>
bringing back a heap of flowers,<br>
having worshipped the World’s-Refuge,<br>
I aspired <span class='add'>to attain</span> that place.<br>
At that time, discerning my wish,<br>
the Refuge-less One prophesied: <a class='vjw' id='vjw10-11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5673-5674'></a> “All of you, look at this great sage,<br>
skin the color of polished gold,<br>
hair growing upward, broad-shouldered,<br>
standing steadfast, hands together,<br>
with eyes which are full of laughter,<br>
at home in praising the Buddha,<br>
grasping the Teaching superbly,<br>
resembling sprinkled ambrosia. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12-13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5675-5676'></a> Hearing <span class='add'>of</span> Kaccāna’s virtue,<br>
he stands <span class='add'>there</span> wishing for that place.<br>
When very far in the future,<br>
the Sage So Great is Gotama,<br>
Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
<span class='add'>this one</span> will be that Teacher’s follower;<br>
his name will be Kaccāna <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14-15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5677'></a> Very learned, with great knowledge,<br>
clever at conclusions, a sage,<br>
he will attain that <span class='add'>wished-for</span> place,<br>
as this has been foretold by me.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5678'></a> In the hundred thousand aeons<br>
since I did that karma back then,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5679'></a> I transmigrate in <span class='add'>just</span> two states:<br>
that of a god, or of a man.<br>
I don’t go to other rebirths:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5680'></a> <span class='add'>When human</span> I‘m born in two clans:<br>
the kṣatriyan or the brahmin.<br>
I don’t get born in lesser clans:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5681-5682'></a> Now, in <span class='add'>my</span> final existence,<br>
I was born in Ujjain city,<br>
sharp, a master of the Vedas,<br>
the son of Tiriṭivaccha,<br>
who was the brahmin counsellor<br>
of the <span class='add'>king</span>, Pajjota Caṇḍa;<br>
my mother’s Candapaduma;<br>
<span class='add'>I’m</span> Kaccāna, with superb skin. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20-21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5683-5684'></a> Dispatched by the earth’s protector<br>
to <span class='add'>go and</span> invite the Buddha,<br>
having seen the Heap of Virtue,<br>
Leader, Door to Freedom City,<br>
and having heard his flawless speech<br>
which cleanses the muck of rebirth,<br>
I attained deathless peacefulness,<br>
with five hundred <span class='add'>associates</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22-23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5685'></a> Clever at conclusions by birth,<br>
very wealthy and good-looking,<br>
I was placed in that foremost place<br>
of the Well-Gone-One, the Wise One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5686'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5687'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5688'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
