<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5956'></a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
the Sage, Knower of Every World,<br>
the One who had <span class='add'>Five</span> Eyes, arose<br>
a hundred thousand aeons hence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5957'></a>The Admonisher, Instructor,<br>
Crosser-Over of all that breathe,<br>
Skilled at Preaching, <span class='add'>he</span>, the Buddha,<br>
caused many folks to cross <span class='add'>the flood</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5958'></a> Merciful, Compassionate One,<br>
Well-Wisher of all that breathe, he<br>
established in the five precepts<br>
all the rivals who had arrived. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5959'></a> In this way he was Unconfused<br>
and Very Well-Known by rivals,<br>
Ornamented by arahants<br>
who were masters <span class='add'>and</span> neutral ones. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5960'></a> The <span class='add'>body of the</span> Sage So Great<br>
rose up fifty-eight cubits <span class='add'>tall</span>;<br>
he was Valuable Like Gold,<br>
Bearing the Thirty-Two Great Marks. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5961'></a> <span class='add'>People’s</span> lifespan at that time was<br>
<span class='add'>fully</span> one hundred thousand years.<br>
Remaining <span class='add'>in the world</span> so long,<br>
he ferried many folks across. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5962'></a> I then <span class='add'>lived</span> in Haṃsavatī,<br>
brahmin master of the mantras.<br>
Approaching the Excellent Man,<br>
I heard the preaching of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>, <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5963'></a> the Great Hero, the <span class='add'>World-</span>Leader,<br>
Confident among Multitudes,<br>
appointing a monk with quick wit,<br>
in that <span class='add'>quality’s</span> foremost place. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5964'></a> After doing deeds at that time<br>
for the Leader and Assembly,<br>
having bowed <span class='add'>my</span> head at <span class='add'>his</span> feet,<br>
I aspired <span class='add'>to attain</span> that place. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5965-5966'></a> With his lovely voice conveying<br>
away <span class='add'>all</span> defilements <span class='add'>and</span> stains,<br>
he as Shiny as Gold Ingots,<br>
the Blessed One then said to me,<br>
“May you be happy and long-lived;<br>
your intention is accomplished.<br>
Hugely <span class='add'>fruitful</span> for you <span class='add'>will be</span><br>
<span class='add'>this</span> deed done for the monks and me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10-11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5967'></a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5968'></a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
the one given the name Rādha<br>
will be the Teacher’s follower.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5969'></a> Glad by reason of your virtue,<br>
the Śākyas’ Son, the Bull of Men,<br>
the Leader’s going to appoint <span class='add'>you</span><br>
foremost of those who have quick wit.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5970'></a> After hearing that I was thrilled,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> then for as long as <span class='add'>I</span> lived,<br>
mindful, loving-hearted <span class='add'>and</span> wise,<br>
I waited on <span class='add'>him</span>, the Victor. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5971'></a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5972'></a> Three hundred times <span class='add'>the lord of gods,</span><br>
I exercised divine rule <span class='add'>there</span>,<br>
and <span class='add'>then</span> five hundred times I was<br>
a king who turns the wheel <span class='add'>of law</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5973'></a> <span class='add'>There was also</span> much local rule,<br>
innumerable by counting.<br>
Through the power of that karma,<br>
I was happy in every place. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5974'></a> When <span class='add'>my</span> last rebirth was attained,<br>
I was born in a brahmin clan,<br>
poor, <span class='add'>and</span> wanting for clothes and food,<br>
in Rajgir, ultimate city. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5975'></a> I gave a ladle’s worth of food<br>
to Sāriputta, neutral one,<br>
when <span class='add'>I</span> was old and decrepit,<br>
and I came to <span class='add'>his</span> hermitage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5976'></a> Nobody was ordaining me,<br>
being old <span class='add'>and</span> of failing strength;<br>
due to that, old and discolored,<br>
I was sorrow<span class='add'>ful</span> at that time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5977'></a> Having seen me, Great Compassion,<br>
the Sage So Great said <span class='add'>this</span> to me:<br>
“What meaning has this sorrow, son?<br>
Tell me of your mental anguish.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5978'></a> “I’m not getting ordained, Hero,<br>
in your well-preached dispensation;<br>
thus I’m miserable with grief;<br>
be <span class='add'>my</span> refuge, O Leader.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5979'></a> Then calling the monks together,<br>
the Seventh Sage questioned <span class='add'>them thus</span>:<br>
“Let them speak, those who remember<br>
the service of this one <span class='add'>for us</span>.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5980'></a> Sāriputta spoke at that time:<br>
“I remember his deed <span class='add'>for us</span>.<br>
He gave a ladleful of food<br>
to me <span class='add'>then</span> wandering for alms.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5981'></a> Excellent, Excellent, grateful<br>
Sāriputta! <span class='add'>Now</span> you ordain<br>
this <span class='add'>man, an</span> elderly brahmin;<br>
he’s going to be a thoroughbred. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5982'></a> Then <span class='add'>I</span> got to go forth <span class='add'>and got</span><br>
ordained with proper ritual.<br>
In a short time <span class='add'>I then</span> attained<br>
destruction of the defilements. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5983'></a> Thrilled <span class='add'>and</span> mindful, I’m listening<br>
carefully to the Sage’s words.<br>
Then the Victor placed me in the<br>
foremost place of those with quick wit. <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5984'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5985'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5986'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
