<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw446'></a> In the city, Haṃsavatī<br>
the brahmin known as Sujāta<br>
was very rich, with great vast wealth,<br>
having saved eight hundred million. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw447'></a> <span class='add'>I</span> was that learned mantra-knower<br>
who had mastered the three Vedas.<br>
I had excelled in Saddhamma,<br>
in reading signs and history. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw448'></a> A great many female renouncers,<br>
with single top-knots, ascetics,<br>
who followed Rishi Gautama,<br>
were wandering around back then. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw449'></a> They then came and surrounded me,<br>
thinking, “he’s a famous brahmin.”<br>
The common people worshipped me<br>
but I worshipped no one at all. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw450'></a> I saw no one worthy of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>;<br>
I was fiercely proud at that time.<br>
The word “Buddha” did not exist <span class='add'>yet</span><br>
as the Victor’d still not been born. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw451'></a> When <span class='add'>many</span> days and nights had passed<br>
the Leader, Padumuttara,<br>
Eyeful One, arose in the world,<br>
dispelling all of its darkness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw452'></a> When <span class='add'>his</span> dispendation had been<br>
explained and spread to many folks,<br>
then <span class='add'>he</span>, the Buddha, did approach<br>
the city called Haṃsa<span class='add'>vati</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw453'></a> In order to assist others<br>
the Eyeful Buddha preached <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>.<br>
At that time his <span class='add'>large</span> retinue<br>
extended for an entire league. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw454'></a> An ascetic named Sunanda<br>
with the favor of the people.<br>
then pleased with flowers everyone<br>
in that Buddha-retinue <span class='add'>there</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw455'></a>On a superb flowered platform<br>
he explained the Four <span class='add'>Noble</span> Truths.<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-comprehension was reached<br>
by a trillion <span class='add'>beings who heard him</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw456'></a> For seven days and nights Buddha<br>
rained forth a shower of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> when the eighth day then did dawn<br>
the Victor spoke of Sunanda: <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw457'></a> “This one, transmigrating in lives<br>
in the gods’ world or that of men,<br>
being most excellent of all<br>
will transmigrate through his lifetimes. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw458'></a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw459'></a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
<span class='add'>he</span> will be that Teacher’s follower<br>
named Mantāṇiputta Puṇṇa.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw460'></a> The Sambuddha spoke in this way<br>
to Sunanda the ascetic,<br>
causing all the people to smile<br>
and displaying his own power. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw461'></a> With hands pressed they showed reverence<br>
to ascetic Sunanda then.<br>
Acting in accord with Buddha<br>
he purified his future state. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw462'></a> <span class='add'>And</span> this thought then occurred to me<br>
on hearing the words of the Sage:<br>
“I also shall act <span class='add'>in that way</span><br>
until I <span class='add'>too</span> see Gotama.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw463'></a> Having thought in this fashion I<br>
then considered the deed I’d do:<br>
“what karma then should I perform<br>
in this unrivaled merit-field? <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw464'></a> This bhikkhu <span class='add'>known as</span> Pāṭhika<br>
is ranked first in the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Vinaya</i><br>
and all the recited teachings;<br>
I will aspire to that status.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw465'></a> I had immeasurable wealth<br>
analogous to the ocean.<br>
With that wealth I caused to be made<br>
an ashram for the <span class='add'>monks and</span> Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw466'></a> That ashram, known as Sobhana<br>
was built to the east of the city.<br>
I spent a hundred thousand <span class='add'>coins</span><br>
<span class='add'>then</span> built that monastic ashram. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw467'></a> Constructing gabled cells, mansions,<br>
platform stages and <span class='add'>also</span> caves,<br>
and making a well-made walkway<br>
I built that monastic ashram. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw468'></a> I caused a bath-house to be made<br>
with heated rooms and a fire-room<br>
beneath the water-storage hall<br>
and gave it to the Assembly. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw469'></a> I gave everything <span class='add'>they would need</span>:<br>
short chairs for sitting and recliners,<br>
vessels for cooking and eating,<br>
and medicines for the ashram. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw470'></a> <span class='add'>Then</span> providing it protection<br>
I had a solid rampart built<br>
so none would do it any harm,<br>
<span class='add'>a place</span> for peaceful meditation. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw471'></a> I built that monastic ashram<br>
with lakhs of quarters for the monks<br>
and filling them abundantly<br>
I <span class='add'>then</span> approached the Sambuddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw472'></a> “I’ve completed the ashram <span class='add'>now</span>;<br>
please may you <span class='add'>therefore</span> accept it.<br>
I’m gifting it to you, Hero,<br>
and the residents, Eyeful One.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw473'></a> Padumuttara, World-Knower,<br>
Sacrificial Recipient,<br>
discerning what I was thinking<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> accepted it, the Leader. <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw474'></a> Learning of the acquiescence<br>
of the Omniscient One, Great Sage,<br>
after the food had been prepared<br>
I announced the time <span class='add'>for giving</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw475'></a> When the time had <span class='add'>thus</span> been announced,<br>
Padumuttara, the Leader,<br>
along with one thousand arahants<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> came to my <span class='add'>splendid</span> ashram. <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw476'></a> Discerning the time to sit down<br>
I entertained with food and drink.<br>
Seeing that they’d finished eating<br>
I <span class='add'>then</span> spoke these words <span class='add'>to him</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw477'></a> “<span class='add'>This</span> ashram known as Sobhana<br>
cost <span class='add'>me</span> one hundred thousand <span class='add'>coins</span><br>
and building it cost so much more;<br>
please may you <span class='add'>therefore</span> accept it. <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw478'></a> Because of giving this ashram<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve<br>
being reborn in lifetimes I<br>
should receive what I’m wishing for.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw479'></a> The Buddha, having accepted<br>
that well-made monastic ashram,<br>
seated in the monks’ Assembly<br>
<span class='add'>then did</span> speak these words <span class='add'>about me</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw480'></a> “This one who gave to the Buddha<br>
a well-made monastic ashram,<br>
I shall relate details of him;<br>
<span class='add'>all of</span> you listen to my words: <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw481'></a> <span class='add'>He said</span>, “The army, with four parts—<br>
tusker, soldier, chariot, horse—<br>
will ceaselessly wait on this one:<br>
fruit of a monastic ashram. <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw482'></a> Sixty thousand instruments <span class='add'>and</span><br>
well-decorated kettle-drums<br>
will ceaselessly attend this one:<br>
fruit of a monastic ashram. <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw483'></a> Women numbering sixteen thousand,<br>
decked out in all the ornaments,<br>
with varied clothes and jewelry<br>
and wearing earrings made of gems, <a class='vjw' id='vjw38'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw484'></a> with long eyelashes, lovely smiles<br>
and slim waists, pleasant to look at,<br>
will ceaselessly wait on this one:<br>
the fruit of a monastic ashram. <a class='vjw' id='vjw39'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw485'></a> He’ll delight in the world of gods<br>
for thirty thousand aeons <span class='add'>hence</span>.<br>
A thousand times the king of gods,<br>
he will exercise divine rule. <a class='vjw' id='vjw40'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw486'></a> Whatever a god-king obtains<br>
he <span class='add'>too</span> will receive all of that.<br>
Not lacking anything at all<br>
he will exercise divine rule. <a class='vjw' id='vjw41'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw487'></a> A thousand times he’s going to be<br>
the wheel-turning king of a country.<br>
His reigns on earth will be many,<br>
innumerable by counting. <a class='vjw' id='vjw42'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw488'></a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw43'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw489'></a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
<span class='add'>this one</span> will be that Teacher’s follower;<br>
his name will be Upāli <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw44'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw490'></a> Excelling in the Vinaya,<br>
skilled in right and wrong conclusions,<br>
furthering the Victor’s teaching<br>
he will live without defilements. <a class='vjw' id='vjw45'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw491'></a> Having recognized all of that,<br>
Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,<br>
seated in the monks’ Assembly<br>
will place him in the foremost place.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw46'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw492'></a> Doing service beyond measure<br>
longing for your dispensation,<br>
I have <span class='add'>now fully</span> reached the goal,<br>
in which all fetters are destroyed. <a class='vjw' id='vjw47'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw493'></a> Just as a man tied to a stake,<br>
fearing punishment by the king,<br>
finding no pleasure in that stake,<br>
would wish only to be set free, <a class='vjw' id='vjw48'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw494'></a> so too am I, O Great Hero,<br>
afraid of rebirth-punishment.<br>
Being bound to the karma-stake<br>
I’m scared of desirous feelings. <a class='vjw' id='vjw49'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw495'></a> I find no pleasure in existence<br>
being burned up by the three fires.<br>
I am seeking liberation<br>
like one punished by the king <span class='add'>does</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw50'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw496'></a> Just as a person who’s been poisoned,<br>
who’s wracked with pain because of that,<br>
would seek after an antidote,<br>
a way to destroy that poison; <a class='vjw' id='vjw51'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw497'></a> and seeking, should he find a cure<br>
that’s able to destroy poison,<br>
drinking it he would be happy<br>
<span class='add'>to be</span> set free from that poison. <a class='vjw' id='vjw52'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw498'></a> Just so am I, O Great Hero,<br>
like him struck down by the poison.<br>
Pained because of <span class='add'>my</span> ignorance<br>
I came for the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Saddhamma</i>-cure. <a class='vjw' id='vjw53'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw499'></a> Searching for that curing <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i><br>
I saw the Śākyan dispensation,<br>
the best among all medicines,<br>
by which all arrows are removed. <a class='vjw' id='vjw54'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw500'></a> Drinking that <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-medicine<br>
I have destroyed every poison.<br>
I have seen tranquil nirvana,<br>
which does not age and does not die. <a class='vjw' id='vjw55'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw501'></a> Just as one frightened by a ghost,<br>
wracked with pain because of that <span class='add'>fear</span><br>
would seek after an exorcist<br>
to free him from that ghost’s <span class='add'>attacks</span>, <a class='vjw' id='vjw56'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw502'></a> and seeking, should he find a man<br>
with skill in exorcising ghosts,<br>
that one would slay the ghost for him,<br>
and wipe it out right to the root. <a class='vjw' id='vjw57'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw503'></a> Just so am I, O Great Hero,<br>
pained because I’m sunk in darkness.<br>
I searched for the world of knowledge<br>
that could free me from this darkness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw58'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw504'></a> And then I saw the Śākyan Sage,<br>
cure for darkness and defilement.<br>
He drove out my mental darkness<br>
like the exorcist does the ghost. <a class='vjw' id='vjw59'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw505'></a> Diverting the stream of being;<br>
he held back the craving-waters;<br>
obliterating all rebirth<br>
like the exorcist, to the root. <a class='vjw' id='vjw60'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw506'></a> Just as a harpy who swoops down<br>
on snakes to serve as his own food<br>
will launch attacks from a great lake<br>
a hundred leagues in each direction, <a class='vjw' id='vjw61'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw507'></a> <span class='add'>and</span> that one, picking up a snake<br>
would hurt it right beneath the head<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> carrying it, take off <span class='add'>again</span>,<br>
flying about the sky at will, <a class='vjw' id='vjw62'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw508'></a> just so am I, O Great Hero,<br>
just as strong as is that harpy.<br>
Searching for the unconditioned<br>
I washed away <span class='add'>all of</span> my stains. <a class='vjw' id='vjw63'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw509'></a> I have seen the superb Teaching,<br>
the peaceful state, <span class='add'>so</span> unsurpassed.<br>
Carrying it, I’m <span class='add'>now</span> dwelling<br>
like the harpy with the serpent. <a class='vjw' id='vjw64'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw510'></a> There is a vine, <i lang='pli' translate='no'>āsāvatī</i>,<br>
which grows up in Indra’s garden.<br>
A single fruit is borne by it<br>
after a thousand years <span class='add'>have passed</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw65'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw511'></a> The gods are looking after that<br>
as long as the fruit may last <span class='add'>there</span>.<br>
Thus indeed the gods do savor<br>
that superb vine, <i lang='pli' translate='no'>āsāvatī</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw66'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw512'></a> For one hundred thousand <span class='add'>years then</span><br>
I did attend upon that Sage,<br>
worshipping him morning and night<br>
just like the gods <i lang='pli' translate='no'>āsāvatī</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw67'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw513'></a> Service which was never-ending,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> worship which was not empty;<br>
for all the time that I had come<br>
not one moment did he fail me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw68'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw514'></a> I witness no re-becoming;<br>
I’ve investigated being;<br>
free of desires <span class='add'>and</span> fully free,<br>
calmed, I’m wandering about <span class='add'>now</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw69'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw515'></a> And just as a lotus flower<br>
blooms due to the rays of the sun,<br>
so too do I, O Great Hero,<br>
bloom because of the Buddha-rays. <a class='vjw' id='vjw70'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw516'></a> Just as male birds are not always<br>
found mating with the female cranes<br>
<span class='add'>but only</span> when the clouds do rumble<br>
do they take them to their wombs, <a class='vjw' id='vjw71'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw517'></a> and for much time they stay pregnant—<br>
as long as the clouds don’t thunder—<br>
then they are freed from that burden<br>
when the clouds are raining <span class='add'>again</span>, <a class='vjw' id='vjw72'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw518'></a> <span class='add'>so</span> when the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-cloud thundered<br>
of Padumuttara Buddha,<br>
due to that <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-cloud’s loud sound<br>
I <span class='add'>then</span> conceived a <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-womb. <a class='vjw' id='vjw73'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw519'></a> Serving for a hundred thousand<br>
<span class='add'>aeons</span> I bore that merit-fetus.<br>
I was not freed from that burden;<br>
the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-cloud did not thunder. <a class='vjw' id='vjw74'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw520'></a> But when you, Sage of the Śākyas<br>
did thunder from your <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-cloud<br>
in lovely Kapilavastu,<br>
I was set free from that burden. <a class='vjw' id='vjw75'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw521'></a> <span class='add'>Then</span> I explained the whole Teaching<br>
and also its four fruits, which are:<br>
emptiness, the absence of marks,<br>
suchness, intentionality. <a class='vjw' id='vjw76'></a></p>
<p class='endsection'>The Second Recitation Portion.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw522'></a>Giving service beyond measure,<br>
longing for your dispensation,<br>
I have <span class='add'>now fully</span> reached the goal,<br>
the state of peace without rival. <a class='vjw' id='vjw77'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw523'></a> I have excelled in <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Vinaya</i><br>
just as had the sage Pāṭhika.<br>
There is no one to rival me;<br>
I further your dispensation. <a class='vjw' id='vjw78'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw524'></a> I’m without any doubts about<br>
the letter as well as the spirit<br>
of both <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Vibhangas</i>, <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Khandakas</i>,<br>
and the <span class='add'><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Parivāra</i></span>, the fifth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw79'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw525'></a> Skilled in rebuking, redressing,<br>
in correct and flawed conclusions,<br>
restoration and expungement—<br>
I have excelled in all regards. <a class='vjw' id='vjw80'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw526'></a> Citing the relevant sentence<br>
in the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Vibhangas</i> and <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Khandhakas</i>,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> disentangling both of them<br>
I make suitable restorations. <a class='vjw' id='vjw81'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw527'></a> Well-skilled in the Pāli language,<br>
wise in what’s meaningful and not,<br>
there’s nothing that’s not known by me,<br>
foremost in the Teacher’s teaching. <a class='vjw' id='vjw82'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw528'></a> I am now skilled in <span class='add'>all</span> matters<br>
in the Śākyan dispensation.<br>
I resolve all perplexities<br>
and cut off every <span class='add'>single</span> doubt. <a class='vjw' id='vjw83'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw529'></a> I am skilled in all the subjects:<br>
prior clauses, subsequent ones,<br>
in the letter and the spirit,<br>
opening frames, concluding ones. <a class='vjw' id='vjw84'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw530'></a> Just as a king with great power<br>
who having rebuked enemies<br>
and triumphing in <span class='add'>his</span> battles<br>
might build a city in that place, <a class='vjw' id='vjw85'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw531'></a> and he’d construct in that city<br>
many ramparts, and trenches too,<br>
gateways with strongholds and pillars,<br>
and high watch-towers of various sorts, <a class='vjw' id='vjw86'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw532'></a> and well-planned bazaars at crossroads<br>
and places where four roads do meet,<br>
and there he’d build a court of law<br>
to settle meanings and lacks thereof. <a class='vjw' id='vjw87'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw533'></a> To censure <span class='add'>all</span> unfriendly <span class='add'>kings</span>,<br>
to make known faults and faultlessness<br>
and for protection he’d appoint<br>
a general of the army <span class='add'>there</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw88'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw534'></a> In order to protect his goods<br>
he would appoint a treasurer,<br>
one with skill in <span class='add'>guarding</span> treasure,<br>
<span class='add'>commanding</span>, “do not waste my goods.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw89'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw535'></a> So that procedures are followed<br>
he’d give the administration<br>
to a friend, the king’s devotee,<br>
desiring his prosperity. <a class='vjw' id='vjw90'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw536'></a> He’d appoint as his adviser<br>
one with <span class='add'>much</span> skill in reading signs<br>
as well as omens which arise,<br>
a learned master of mantras. <a class='vjw' id='vjw91'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw537'></a> <span class='add'>Thereby</span> endowed with <span class='add'>all</span> these limbs<br>
he would be called “a Kṣatriyan”.<br>
Always they would protect the king<br>
like a goose <span class='add'>protects</span> the injured. <a class='vjw' id='vjw92'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw538'></a> Thus indeed are you, Great Hero,<br>
a Kṣatriyan with slain enemies.<br>
You are called the King of Teaching<br>
in this world including the gods. <a class='vjw' id='vjw93'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw539'></a> Having destroyed the heretics<br>
and Māra with his army <span class='add'>too</span>,<br>
driving out that cause of darkness<br>
you built a city of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw94'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw540'></a> Morality’s the ramparts there;<br>
your knowledge, the gates and strongholds;<br>
faith in you, the pillar, Wise One;<br>
restraint, the sentry at the door. <a class='vjw' id='vjw95'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw541'></a> Mindfulness is the high watch-tower;<br>
you wisdom is the crossroads, Sage;<br>
the superpowers, where four roads meet;<br>
the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-road’s well-constructed. <a class='vjw' id='vjw96'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw542'></a> Your court of law consists of the<br>
nine-fold teaching of the Buddha,<br>
the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Suttas</i> and <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Abhidhamma</i><br>
and the whole of the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Vinaya</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw97'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw543'></a> Emptiness, the absence of marks,<br>
dwelling wanting very little,<br>
desirelessness and cessation:<br>
<span class='add'>all of</span> these form your <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-hut. <a class='vjw' id='vjw98'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw544'></a> At the top of those with wisdom<br>
and skilled in understanding too,<br>
the one known as Sāriputta’s<br>
general of your <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-army. <a class='vjw' id='vjw99'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw545'></a> Wise in the four sudden events,<br>
excelling in the super powers,<br>
the one who’s known as Kolita<br>
is your top adviser, O Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw100'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw546'></a> Bearer of the ancient lineage,<br>
hard to approach, of mighty power,<br>
foremost in ascetic virtue,<br>
<span class='add'>Kassapa</span>’s Prime Minister, Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw101'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw547'></a> The learned bearer of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
reciter of all the teachings,<br>
the one who’s known as Ānanda<br>
<span class='add'>serves as</span> your <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-guard, O Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw102'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw548'></a> Passing over all of those <span class='add'>monks</span><br>
the Blessed One did reckon me<br>
best explainer of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Vinaya</i><br>
and gave my judgments <span class='add'>authority</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw103'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw549'></a> Whatever Buddha-follower<br>
raises some <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Vinaya</i> question,<br>
there without my even thinking<br>
I relate the answer to that. <a class='vjw' id='vjw104'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw550'></a> Throughout the entire Buddha-field<br>
except <span class='add'>of course</span> for you, Great Sage,<br>
in <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Vinaya</i> there’s no rival;<br>
where would someone better come from? <a class='vjw' id='vjw105'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw551'></a> Seated in the monks’ Assembly<br>
Gotama thus thundered forth <span class='add'>then</span>:<br>
“There’s no rival for Upāli<br>
in <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Vibhangas</i> and <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Khandhakas</i>.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw106'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw552'></a> Teacher’s nine-fold dispensation<br>
as far as the Buddha’s preached it<br>
is all found in the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Vinaya</i><br>
for one who knows it to the root. <a class='vjw' id='vjw107'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw553'></a> Remembering my <span class='add'>past</span> karma<br>
Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,<br>
seated in the monks’ Assembly<br>
did place me in the foremost place. <a class='vjw' id='vjw108'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw554'></a> Having served one hundred thousand<br>
<span class='add'>aeons</span> while longing for this place,<br>
I have <span class='add'>now fully</span> reached the goal,<br>
excelling in the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Vinaya</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw109'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw555'></a> I was formerly a barber<br>
bringing the Śākyas happiness.<br>
The son of the Great Sage was born<br>
after I’d abandoned that clan. <a class='vjw' id='vjw110'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw556'></a> In the second aeon ago<br>
there lived Kṣatriyan Añjasa<br>
of boundless might and measureless fame,<br>
king of the earth, and very rich. <a class='vjw' id='vjw111'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw557'></a> I was <span class='add'>then</span> the son of that king,<br>
the Kṣatriyan named Candana.<br>
I was puffed up with pride of clan<br>
and pride about my fame and wealth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw112'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw558'></a> One hundred thousand elephants<br>
decked out in all the ornaments,<br>
in rut in three ways, <i lang='pli' translate='no'>mātaṅgas</i>,<br>
waited on me all of the time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw113'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw559'></a> Wishing to go to the garden<br>
surrounded by my army, I<br>
mounted the elephant Sirika<br>
then headed out from the city. <a class='vjw' id='vjw114'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw560'></a> The <span class='add'>Lonely</span> Buddha Devala<br>
abundant in perfect conduct,<br>
self-controlled with doors well-guarded<br>
approached my city <span class='add'>at that time</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw115'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw561'></a> Driving Sirika the tusker<br>
I insulted that Buddha then.<br>
Due to that, with ire arisen,<br>
he would never lift his foot. <a class='vjw' id='vjw116'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw562'></a> Having seen <span class='add'>my</span> tusker’s bad mood<br>
I got angry at the Buddha.<br>
Having harassed the Sambuddha<br>
I <span class='add'>then</span> went into the garden. <a class='vjw' id='vjw117'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw563'></a> I felt no pleasure in that moment<br>
as though my head were set ablaze.<br>
I was burning up with anguish<br>
just like a fish caught on the hook. <a class='vjw' id='vjw118'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw564'></a> I felt the whole earth was burning<br>
all the way to the ocean’s edge.<br>
Going to my father’s presence<br>
I spoke these words <span class='add'>to him just then</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw119'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw565'></a> “My insult to that Self-Become One<br>
is like a very angry snake,<br>
it’s like a mass of fire that’s come,<br>
it’s like a drunk tusked elephant. <a class='vjw' id='vjw120'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw566'></a> It’s awful that I’ve insulted<br>
that Buddha, Victor, Fiercely Strong.<br>
We’ll bring our cities all to ruin;<br>
let’s seek the pardon of that sage.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw121'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw567'></a> “If we don’t make him understand,<br>
that Self-Tamed One, Self-Controlled One,<br>
then on the seventh day from now<br>
my country will <span class='add'>all</span> be destroyed. <a class='vjw' id='vjw122'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw568'></a> Sumekhala the Kosiyan<br>
and Siggava, so Sattuka,<br>
after they’d insulted sages<br>
came to grief, as did their armies. <a class='vjw' id='vjw123'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw569'></a> Whenever sages get enraged,<br>
well-trained ones who are celibate,<br>
they cause <span class='add'>the world</span> to be destroyed<br>
with its gods, oceans and mountains.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw124'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw570'></a> I assembled <span class='add'>all</span> the people<br>
throughout three hundred thousand leagues.<br>
In order to discuss that crime,<br>
I approached the Self-Become One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw125'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw571'></a> Wearing wet clothes, bearing wet heads,<br>
everyone pressed hands together.<br>
Falling down at the Buddha’s feet<br>
I spoke these words <span class='add'>to him just then</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw126'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw572'></a> “Please show forgiveness, Great Hero;<br>
the populace is begging you.<br>
Please extinguish this awful fire;<br>
and don’t destroy the <span class='add'>whole</span> country. <a class='vjw' id='vjw127'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw573'></a> All the gods and also the men<br>
and titans and spirits as well,<br>
would constantly break my head open<br>
with a hammer made of iron.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw128'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw574'></a> “Fire does not survive in water<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> seeds don’t germinate in rock;<br>
worms don’t survive in medicine;<br>
there’s no anger in a Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw129'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw575'></a> Like the earth, which is unshaken<br>
and the ocean, beyond measure,<br>
and the sky, which has no limit,<br>
so the Buddha can’t be perturbed. <a class='vjw' id='vjw130'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw576'></a> Great Heroes who are ascetics<br>
are patient and forgiving <span class='add'>folks</span>.<br>
Such patient, forgiving people<br>
do not consider your <span class='add'>wrong</span> course.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw131'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw577'></a> The Sambuddha, having said this,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> extinguished that awful fire.<br>
Then in front of everyone <span class='add'>there</span><br>
he flew right up into the sky. <a class='vjw' id='vjw132'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw578'></a> Wise One, due to that <span class='add'>bad</span> action<br>
I attained inferior birth;<br>
<span class='add'>now</span> passing beyond that station,<br>
I’ve come to the fearless city. <a class='vjw' id='vjw133'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw579'></a> Then, Great Hero, <span class='add'>having seen</span> me,<br>
well-settled <span class='add'>but</span> being burnt up,<br>
that Self-Become <span class='add'>Lonely Buddha</span><br>
drove off the fire <span class='add'>and</span> forgave <span class='add'>me</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw134'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw580'></a> Even so today, Great Hero,<br>
you have extinguished the three fires,<br>
relieving me who was being<br>
burnt up by those <span class='add'>self-same</span> three fires. <a class='vjw' id='vjw135'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw581'></a> Let those of you with ears to hear,<br>
<span class='add'>all of</span> you, listen to my words:<br>
I’m declaring the facts for you<br>
of how I came to see this state. <a class='vjw' id='vjw136'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw582'></a> Sneering at the Self-Become One,<br>
peaceful-hearted <span class='add'>and</span> attentive,<br>
today, due to that <span class='add'>bad</span> karma,<br>
I am born in this low-caste womb. <a class='vjw' id='vjw137'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw583'></a> Don’t transgress even one moment;<br>
you will grieve for the moment missed.<br>
The moment is prepared for you:<br>
endeavor <span class='add'>now</span> for your own good. <a class='vjw' id='vjw138'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw584'></a> The poison <span class='add'>called</span> <i lang='pli' translate='no'>haḷāhaḷa</i><br>
in some <span class='add'>is cured</span> by vomiting.<br>
For some <span class='add'>the antidote</span> is purging,<br>
for others medicinal herbs. <a class='vjw' id='vjw139'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw585'></a> With reference to merit-field-seekers,<br>
for those on the path <span class='add'>the cure</span> is vomit;<br>
for those after path-fruits it’s a purge;<br>
for the fruit-attainers, medicinal herbs. <a class='vjw' id='vjw140'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw586'></a> Those who would oppose the teaching<br>
are poisoned as with <i lang='pli' translate='no'>haḷāhaḷa</i>:<br>
a snake’s venom, poison eaten,<br>
surely is going to harm that man. <a class='vjw' id='vjw141'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw587'></a> Only once does <i lang='pli' translate='no'>haḷāhaḷa</i><br>
bring about the end of <span class='add'>one’s</span> life.<br>
After opposing the teaching<br>
he burns for ten million aeons. <a class='vjw' id='vjw142'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw588'></a> Patiently and non-violently,<br>
with loving-kindness in his heart,<br>
<span class='add'>Buddha</span> helps <span class='add'>this world</span> with its gods.<br>
Therefore you shouldn’t oppose him. <a class='vjw' id='vjw143'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw589'></a> Unattached to getting or not,<br>
whether honored or insulted,<br>
Buddhas are <span class='add'>steady</span> like the earth;<br>
therefore they shouldn’t be opposed. <a class='vjw' id='vjw144'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw590'></a> The Sage is just the same toward all,<br>
Devadatta the murderer,<br>
the thief Angulimālaka,<br>
Dhanapāla and Rāhula. <a class='vjw' id='vjw145'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw591'></a> They don’t experience anger;<br>
passion is never found in them.<br>
The Buddha’s just the same toward all,<br>
a murderer <span class='add'>or</span> his own son. <a class='vjw' id='vjw146'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw592'></a> Seeing a robe atop a tree—<br>
discarded, smeared with excrement—<br>
one should press the hands, head bowed;<br>
that sages’ flag should be worshipped. <a class='vjw' id='vjw147'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw593'></a> <span class='add'>All of</span> the Buddhas of the past<br>
and the present and future <span class='add'>too,</span><br>
purify themselves with that flag;<br>
therefore they ought to be worshipped. <a class='vjw' id='vjw148'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw594'></a> With my heart I bear <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Vinaya</i>,<br>
almost the same as the Teacher.<br>
I will always live my life <span class='add'>by</span><br>
paying homage to <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Vinaya</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw149'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw595'></a> <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Vinaya</i>’s my inclination;<br>
it’s my walking meditation.<br>
I make my home in <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Vinaya</i>;<br>
the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Vinaya</i> is my pasture. <a class='vjw' id='vjw150'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw596'></a> I have excelled in Vinaya,<br>
skilled in mental tranquility.<br>
Great Hero, Teacher, Upāli<br>
is now venerating your feet. <a class='vjw' id='vjw151'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw597'></a> I’ll wander village to village<br>
and <span class='add'>also</span> city to city<br>
paying homage to Sambuddha<br>
and to the practice of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw152'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw598'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw153'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw599'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw154'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw600'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw155'></a></p>
