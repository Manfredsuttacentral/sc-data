<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5769'></a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
the Sage, Knower of Every World,<br>
the One who had <span class='add'>Five</span> Eyes, arose<br>
a hundred thousand aeons hence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5770'></a> The Admonisher, Instructor,<br>
Crosser-Over of all that breathe,<br>
Skilled at Preaching, <span class='add'>he</span>, the Buddha,<br>
caused many folks to cross <span class='add'>the flood</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5771'></a> Merciful, Compassionate One,<br>
Well-Wisher of all that breathe, he<br>
established in the five precepts<br>
all the rivals who had arrived. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5772'></a> In this way he was Unconfused<br>
and Very Well-Known by rivals,<br>
Ornamented by arahants<br>
who were masters <span class='add'>and</span> neutral ones. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5773'></a> The <span class='add'>body of the</span> Sage So Great<br>
rose up fifty-eight cubits <span class='add'>tall</span>;<br>
he was Valuable Like Gold,<br>
Bearing the Thirty-Two Great Marks. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5774'></a> <span class='add'>People’s</span> lifespan at that time was<br>
<span class='add'>fully</span> one hundred thousand years.<br>
Remaining <span class='add'>in the world</span> so long,<br>
he ferried many folks across. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5775'></a> I was then a millionaire’s son<br>
in Haṃsavatī, of great fame.<br>
Approaching the Lamp of the World,<br>
I heard the preaching of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5776'></a> I was happy after hearing<br>
the words of <span class='add'>the Buddha</span> praising<br>
his follower, the <span class='add'>monk who was</span><br>
appointing lodgings for the monks. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5777'></a> <span class='add'>My</span> head bowed at the feet of the<br>
Great Sage, I aspired to attain<br>
that place, <span class='add'>foremost</span> among those who<br>
do the Assembly's management. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5778'></a> At that time the Great Hero spoke;<br>
he praised my karma <span class='add'>in this way</span>:<br>
“Who fed the Leader of the World,<br>
with the Assembly, for a week, <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5779'></a> whose eyes are <span class='add'>just like</span> lotus leaves,<br>
lion-shouldered, with golden skin;<br>
fallen down in front of my feet,<br>
he has wished for that <span class='add'>foremost</span> place. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5780'></a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5781'></a> That Buddha’s follower <span class='add'>will be</span><br>
well-known by the name of Dabba.<br>
This one is going to be the top<br>
assigner of the lodgings then.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5782'></a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5783'></a> Three hundred times <span class='add'>the lord of gods,</span><br>
I exercised divine rule <span class='add'>there</span>,<br>
and <span class='add'>then</span> five hundred times I was<br>
a king who turns the wheel <span class='add'>of law</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5784'></a> <span class='add'>There was also</span> much local rule,<br>
innumerable by counting.<br>
Through the power of that karma,<br>
I was happy in every place. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5785'></a> The Leader known as Vipassi,<br>
with Insight into Everything,<br>
Charming-Eyed One, arose in the<br>
world, ninety-one aeons ago. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5786'></a> Evil-minded, I reproached a<br>
follower of that Neutral One<br>
who had destroyed all defilements,<br>
despite having known, “he is pure.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5787'></a> Having provided meal-tickets,<br>
I offered rice <span class='add'>well-cooked</span> in milk<br>
to great sages, the followers<br>
of that very Hero of Men. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5788'></a> During this auspicious aeon<br>
Brahmā’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,<br>
named Kassapa through <span class='add'>his</span> lineage,<br>
Best Debater, <span class='add'>Buddha,</span> arose. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5789'></a> Lighting up the dispensation,<br>
overcoming evil rivals,<br>
instructing the instruct-able, he<br>
reached nirvana, with followers. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5790'></a> Hair-loosened, teary-faced, the gods,<br>
were moved <span class='add'>and</span> they wept when the Lord<br>
and students reached nirvana, <span class='add'>his</span><br>
dispensation reaching <span class='add'>its</span> goal: <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5791'></a> “Alas! We have little merit.<br>
The <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-Eye passes away.<br>
We’ll not see the compliant ones,<br>
we will not hear the great Teaching.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5792'></a> <span class='add'>Just</span> then the whole of this <span class='add'>great</span> earth,<br>
which is unshaking, shook with shakes,<br>
and the ocean, as though in grief,<br>
was crying a piteous song. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5793'></a> <span class='add'>And</span> drums in <span class='add'>all</span> four directions,<br>
were played by non-human beings;<br>
lightening burst out from everywhere,<br>
frightening <span class='add'>beings who were there</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5794'></a> Meteors fell down from the sky,<br>
and he whose flag is smoke was seen.<br>
The wild beasts roared piteously,<br>
and all the creatures born on earth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5795'></a> Seeing fierce omens marking the<br>
setting of the dispensation,<br>
moved, we monks who <span class='add'>still remained</span> there,<br>
then thought <span class='add'>about it in this way</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5796'></a> “<span class='add'>Now</span>, without our dispensation,<br>
enough with life <span class='add'>itself for us</span>.<br>
Entering the forest we’ll strive<br>
in the Victor’s dispensation.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5797'></a> We saw a tall, superb mountain<br>
<span class='add'>there</span> in the forest at that time.<br>
Ascending by a flight of stairs,<br>
we fell down on the flight of stairs. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5798-5799'></a> Then an elder admonished us:<br>
“A Buddha’s rising’s hard to get;<br>
well-got for you is getting faith,<br>
the dispensation’s small remnant.<br>
Fallen down they’re missing <span class='add'>their</span> chance,<br>
in the endless suffering-sea.<br>
Therefore strong effort should be made<br>
while the Sage’s thought remains.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw30-31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5800'></a> That elder was an arahant,<br>
a non-returner followed him.<br>
Fixed in good morality, the<br>
rest <span class='add'>of us</span> went to the gods’ world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5801-5802'></a> In the pure abode that one <span class='add'>monk</span><br>
reached nirvana, crossed existence;<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> I and Pukkusāti <span class='add'>too</span>,<br>
Sabhiya, likewise Bāhiya,<br>
so too Kumāra-Kassapa,<br>
reborn here and there we are <span class='add'>now</span><br>
freed from the bonds of existence,<br>
pitied by Gotama <span class='add'>Buddha</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw33-34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5803'></a> Born a Kusināran Malla,<br>
even in the womb I’m conscious.<br>
Dead mother raised up on a pyre;<br>
I was <span class='add'>one who</span> fell out from that. <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5804'></a> I landed on a pile of wood;<br>
therefore I was known as “Dabba.”<br>
Through the strength of holy living,<br>
I was freed, <span class='add'>just</span> seven years old. <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5805'></a> Due to the fruit of the milk-rice,<br>
I’m endowed with the five fine traits;<br>
due to reproaching the pure monk,<br>
I was urged by many bad folks. <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5806'></a> Now I am one who’s passed beyond<br>
both merit and evil <span class='add'>karma</span>.<br>
Attaining supreme peacefulness,<br>
I am <span class='add'>now</span> living, undefiled. <a class='vjw' id='vjw38'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5807'></a> Making the compliant ones laugh,<br>
I appointed lodgings <span class='add'>for them</span>.<br>
The Victor, pleased by that virtue,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> placed me in that foremost place. <a class='vjw' id='vjw39'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5808'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw40'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5809'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw41'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5810'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw42'></a></p>
