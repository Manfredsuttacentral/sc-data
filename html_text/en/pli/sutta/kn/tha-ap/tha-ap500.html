<p><a class='jw' id='jw5304'></a> In the Himalayan region,<br>
there’s a mountain named Samaṅga.<br>
I had a well-built hermitage<br>
furnished with halls of leaves <span class='add'>there then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5305'></a> Named Nārada, with matted hair,<br>
<span class='add'>I</span> practiced fierce austerities.<br>
Fourteen thousand students <span class='add'>back then</span><br>
are worshipping me <span class='add'>in that place</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5306'></a> Being off in solitude <span class='add'>then,</span><br>
I contemplated <span class='add'>in this way</span>:<br>
“All of the people worship me<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> I don’t worship anyone. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5307'></a> I do not have an advisor;<br>
there is no one who speaks to me;<br>
no teacher <span class='add'>and no</span> preceptor,<br>
I come to a home in the woods. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5308'></a> There is not a teacher for me<br>
whom I am giving honor to,<br>
and serving with respectful heart;<br>
my forest-dwelling’s meaningless. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5309'></a> I’ll search for one to give gifts to,<br>
and to be respected <span class='add'>by me</span>;<br>
I will live <span class='add'>enjoying</span> his help,<br>
whom no one will find blameworthy. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5310'></a> <span class='add'>Very</span> near my hermitage,<br>
there was a river with high banks,<br>
with good slopes, which was beautiful<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> strewn about with pure white sand. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5311'></a> Having approached it at that time,<br>
the river named named Amarika,<br>
after piling up <span class='add'>some</span> sand, I<br>
built a stupa <span class='add'>out of that</span> sand. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5312'></a> “Those <span class='add'>men</span> who were the Sambuddhas,<br>
Enders of Becoming, Sages,<br>
I’ll make <span class='add'>this</span> with the marks of a<br>
stupa such-like <span class='add'>those built</span> for them.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5313'></a> Having built <span class='add'>my</span> stupa of sand,<br>
<span class='add'>as though</span> I made it out of gold,<br>
I covered <span class='add'>it</span> with three thousand<br>
gold-colored <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kiṅkhani</i> flowers. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5314'></a> I am praising evening and morn,<br>
filled with joy, hands pressed together.<br>
As though facing the Sambuddha,<br>
I worshipped <span class='add'>that</span> stupa of sand. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5315'></a> When defilements get produced <span class='add'>or</span><br>
pre-occupations with the house,<br>
I recall <span class='add'>that</span> well-made stupa,<br>
and always look at <span class='add'>them like this</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5316'></a> “Living having depended on<br>
the Meaning-Conveyor, the Guide,<br>
it’s not appropriate for you<br>
to live with defilements, Good Sir. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5317'></a> When I bend down at the stupa,<br>
then respect arises in me;<br>
I drive out bad reflections like<br>
an elephant pained by the goad. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5318'></a> The King of Death <span class='add'>then</span> trampled me,<br>
conducting <span class='add'>my</span> life in that way.<br>
Passing away <span class='add'>right</span> on the spot,<br>
I went to the world of Brahmā. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5319'></a> Dwelling there for the whole lifespan,<br>
I was born among the thirty.<br>
Eighty times the lord of the gods,<br>
I exercised divine rule <span class='add'>there</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5320'></a> And <span class='add'>then</span> three hundred times I was<br>
a king who turns the wheel <span class='add'>of law</span>,<br>
<span class='add'>and I enjoyed</span> much local rule,<br>
innumerable by counting. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5321'></a> I’m enjoying the results of<br>
three <span class='add'>thousand</span> <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kiṅkhani</i> flowers.<br>
Twenty-two thousand <span class='add'>people are</span><br>
waiting on me in <span class='add'>every</span> life. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5322'></a> Due to worshipping the stupa,<br>
I am not soiled with dirt and dust;<br>
my limbs are not exuding sweat;<br>
I’m radiantly beautiful. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5323'></a> O! the stupa well-made by me;<br>
Amarika River’s well-seen!<br>
Having built a stupa of sand,<br>
I’ve attained the unshaking state. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5324'></a> “Field” or “Not-Field” aren’t <span class='add'>distingished</span><br>
by a person seeking the pith,<br>
who desires to do wholesome deeds;<br>
<span class='add'>his</span> practice is <span class='add'>thus</span> accomplished. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5325-5326'></a> Just as a person with great strength<br>
is able to cross a river;<br>
carrying a protective stick,<br>
he would spring across a large lake,<br>
so I, depending on this stick,<br>
will cross the great sea <span class='add'>of being</span>:<br>
through <span class='add'>his</span> effort and energy<br>
a man would cross over the sea. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22-23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5327'></a> And so too the karma I did,<br>
which was <span class='add'>my</span> little protection;<br>
depending on <span class='add'>that</span> karma done,<br>
I crossed over re-becoming. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5328'></a> When <span class='add'>my</span> last rebirth was attained,<br>
incited by <span class='add'>my</span> wholesome roots,<br>
I am reborn in Śrāvasti,<br>
in a wealthy <span class='add'>clan</span> with big halls. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5329'></a> My mother and father had faith,<br>
gone to the Buddha for refuge;<br>
they had both seen the <span class='add'>deathless</span> state,<br>
turning to the dispensation. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5330'></a> Taking bark from the Bodhi <span class='add'>tree</span><br>
they built a stupa <span class='add'>made of</span> gold.<br>
They’re praising it evening and morn,<br>
face to face with the Śākyas’ Son. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5331'></a> They passed three watches of the night,<br>
praising the Buddha’s appearance,<br>
outside the stupa made of gold,<br>
on a day when the moon was full. <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5332'></a> I, having seen the <span class='add'>gold</span> stupa,<br>
remembered the stupa of sand.<br>
Sitting down on a single seat,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5333'></a> The Twenty-Second Recitation Portion<br>
Searching for him, the <span class='add'>Great</span> Hero,<br>
I saw the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s general.<br>
Having departed from the house,<br>
I went forth in that one’s presence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5334'></a> Being <span class='add'>only</span> seven years old,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship.<br>
Knowing <span class='add'>my</span> virtue, the Buddha,<br>
the Eyeful One, <span class='add'>then</span> ordained <span class='add'>me</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5336'></a> The work has been completed by<br>
me, even when <span class='add'>I</span> was a child;<br>
what’s to be done was done by me,<br>
in the Buddha’s dispensation. <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5337'></a>All hate <span class='add'>and</span> fear is in the past;<br>
all bonds overcome, <span class='add'>I’m</span> a sage.<br>
I’m you’re follower, Great Hero:<br>
the fruit of a golden stupa. <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5338'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5339'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5340'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
