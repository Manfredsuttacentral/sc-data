<p><a class='jw' id='jw1806'></a> When Vipassi <span class='add'>Buddha</span> was born,<br>
I interpreted the omens:<br>
“A Buddha is born in the world;<br>
he’ll make people reach nirvana.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1807'></a> And when that one was being born,<br>
the ten-thousand world-system quaked.<br>
Now that Blessed One, the Teacher,<br>
Eyeful One is preaching <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1808'></a> And when that one was being born,<br>
there was a vast effulgence <span class='add'>there</span>.<br>
Now that Blessed One, the Teacher,<br>
Eyeful One is preaching <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1809'></a> And when that one was being born,<br>
<span class='add'>all</span> the rivers <span class='add'>then</span> stopped flowing.<br>
Now that Blessed One, the Teacher,<br>
Eyeful One is preaching <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1810'></a> And when that one was being born,<br>
<span class='add'>all</span> the fires of hell stopped burning.<br>
Now that Blessed One, the Teacher,<br>
Eyeful One is preaching <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1811'></a> And when that one was being born,<br>
<span class='add'>all</span> the flocks of birds stopped flying.<br>
Now that Blessed One, the Teacher,<br>
Eyeful One is preaching <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1812'></a> And when that one was being born,<br>
<span class='add'>the powerful</span> winds stopped blowing.<br>
Now that Blessed One, the Teacher,<br>
Eyeful One is preaching <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1813'></a> And when that one was being born,<br>
all the gemstones were glistening.<br>
Now that Blessed One, the Teacher,<br>
Eyeful One is preaching <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1814'></a> And when that one was being born,<br>
<span class='add'>his first</span> seven steps were taken.<br>
Now that Blessed One, the Teacher,<br>
Eyeful One is preaching <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1815'></a> And when the Sambuddha was born,<br>
he surveyed all the directions.<br>
and <span class='add'>then he</span> spoke majestic words;<br>
that is the nature of Buddhas.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1816'></a> After he made people feel moved,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> I had praised the World-Leader,<br>
having worshipped the Sambuddha,<br>
I departed facing the east. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1817'></a> In the ninety-one aeons since<br>
I praised the Buddha in that way,<br>
