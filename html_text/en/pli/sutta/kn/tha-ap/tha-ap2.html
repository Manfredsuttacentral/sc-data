<h1>The Legend of the Lonely Buddhas</h1>
</header>
<p>Now listen to the legend of the Lonely Buddhas:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw82'></a> The Sage of Vedeha, his body bent, asked<br>
the Thus-Gone-One dwelling in Jetavana,<br>
“Indeed there are those <span class='add'>called</span> the Lonely Buddhas;<br>
through what causes do they become <span class='add'>so</span>, Wise One?” <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw83'></a> Then spoke the Omniscient, Outstanding, Great Sage,<br>
to lucky Ānanda with <span class='add'>his</span> honeyed voice,<br>
“Who performed service among former Buddhas,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> didn’t get freed in their dispensations, <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw84'></a> because that is the means to awaken, wise,<br>
they with sharp knowing, through knowledge and power,<br>
because of <span class='add'>their</span> wishes <span class='add'>and</span> also great strength,<br>
reach the Awakening of Lonely <span class='add'>Buddhas</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw85'></a> In every world, with the exception of me,<br>
there is no equal for the Lonely Buddhas.<br>
I will describe a piece of the excellent<br>
character of those Buddhas, the Great Sages.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw86'></a> All of you, with well-pleased minds, aspiring for<br>
the unsurpassed medicine, hear, by yourselves,<br>
the excellent sayings, which are short and sweet,<br>
of those Great Sages who were Lonely Buddhas, <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw87'></a> which are explanations of generations<br>
of Lonely Buddhas who gathered together,<br>
and a story of dispassion for danger,<br>
and likewise <span class='add'>how</span> they achieved Awakening. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw88'></a> With awareness detached from passionate things,<br>
mind not delighting in delights in the world,<br>
abandoning obstacles, throbbing conquered,<br>
thereby indeed they achieved Awakening. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw89'></a> Putting away the stick among all beings,<br>
not causing harm to a single one of them,<br>
with a loving mind, friendly, compassionate,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw90'></a> Putting away the stick among all beings,<br>
not causing harm to a single one of them,<br>
not wishing for sons, let alone companions,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw91'></a> Affections arise for one with connections;<br>
this dis-ease proceeds in line with affections.<br>
Seeing the danger that’s born of affections,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw92'></a> Feeling compassion for friends <span class='add'>and</span> companions,<br>
one puts off the goal, mind tied <span class='add'>to their problems</span>;<br>
seeing that fearfulness in intimacy,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw93'></a> One who is attentive to sons and to wives<br>
is entangled like a large bamboo <span class='add'>thicket</span>.<br>
Not stuck to others, like a new bamboo shoot,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw94'></a> Just as a deer, not ensnared, goes for pasture<br>
in the forest according to <span class='add'>its</span> wishes,<br>
a knowing man looks after independence;<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw95'></a> Resting, standing, going, wandering there is<br>
<span class='add'>some</span> invitation amidst <span class='add'>one’s</span> companions.<br>
Looking after independence <span class='add'>most</span> don’t want,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw96'></a> Amidst <span class='add'>one’s</span> companions there is delighting<br>
in sports, and there is abundant love for sons.<br>
<span class='add'>Though</span> hating separation from what’s held dear,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw97'></a> Global in outlook, one is causing no harm,<br>
being happy with whatever comes one’s way;<br>
an endurer of troubles, not stiff with fear,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw98'></a> Even some who have gone forth are ill-disposed;<br>
likewise <span class='add'>some</span> householders living in the house.<br>
Being unconcerned about others’ children,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw99'></a> Shedding the attributes of life in the house<br>
like an ebony tree whose leaves have fallen,<br>
the hero severs the ties to household life;<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw100'></a> If one should obtain a clever companion,<br>
a co-wanderer who lives well <span class='add'>and</span> is wise,<br>
after having overcome every trouble,<br>
one would wander with that one, thrilled <span class='add'>and</span> mindful. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw101'></a> If one should not get a clever companion,<br>
a co-wanderer who lives well <span class='add'>and</span> is wise,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> like a king quitting a conquered kingdom,<br>
one should wander alone, like tuskers in the woods. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw102'></a> Truly we’re praising success with companions;<br>
those who are better or equal should be served.<br>
Not getting those, not enjoying sinful things,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw103'></a> Seeing shiny <span class='add'>bangles made out</span> of <span class='add'>fine</span> gold,<br>
which have been well-made by the son of a smith,\<br>
banging together when two are on <span class='add'>one</span> arm<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw104'></a> “Like that, with another, there will be for me,<br>
meaningless chatter or ill-tempered <span class='add'>bad speech</span>;”<br>
seeing that as a danger for the future,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw105'></a> Sense pleasures are varied, sweet and delightful;<br>
<span class='add'>they</span> churn up the mind with <span class='add'>their</span> varying form.<br>
Seeing danger in the strands of sense pleasure,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw106'></a> “For me this is calamity, misfortune;<br>
a sickness, a <span class='add'>sharp</span> arrow, a fearsome thing.”<br>
Seeing this fear in the strands of sense pleasure,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw107'></a> <span class='add'>Freezing</span> cold and <span class='add'>scorching</span> heat, hunger and thirst,<br>
wind <span class='add'>and</span> hot weather and gadflies <span class='add'>and</span> serpents:<br>
having vanquished even all of those <span class='add'>problems,</span><br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw108'></a> Just as a noble elephant with a full-<br>
grown spotted body, abandoning the herd,<br>
might dwell in the woods, however it wishes,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw109'></a> “One who is fond of company cannot touch<br>
liberation, even temporarily.”<br>
Heeding with care <span class='add'>those</span> words of the Sun’s Kinsman,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw110'></a> Freed from <span class='add'>incessant</span> wrangling of opinions,<br>
gaining the way, getting the path, <span class='add'>with the thought,</span><br>
“I know I am not to be led by others,”<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw111'></a> Freed from greed, without deceit, <span class='add'>and</span> thirst-free,<br>
lacking hypocrisy, fault- and folly-free,<br>
becoming intention-free in the whole world,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw112'></a> Avoiding, not consorting with an evil<br>
companion, who is blind to the goal, who gets<br>
into trouble, who intends <span class='add'>things</span>, is slothful,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw113'></a> One should consort with <span class='add'>someone</span> noble, a friend,<br>
very learned, <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-bearer, skilled preacher.<br>
Discerning <span class='add'>one’s own</span> goals, removing <span class='add'>all</span> doubt,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw114'></a> Not embellishing, not looking after sport<br>
nor delights, pleasures, happiness in the world;<br>
abstaining from adornment, telling the truth,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw115'></a> Having given up sense pleasures completely,<br>
<span class='add'>including</span> sons and wives, father <span class='add'>and</span> mother,<br>
wealth and grain and also <span class='add'>all one’s</span> relatives,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw116'></a> Mindful, discerning, “this is an attachment;<br>
the happiness here is trifling, little fun;<br>
here there is much suffering, this is a shaft,”<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw117'></a> Having broken to bits <span class='add'>one’s own</span> hindrances,<br>
like a fish breaking a net in the water,<br>
like fire that does not return to what is burnt,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw118'></a> With eyes cast downward, not <span class='add'>just</span> goofing around,<br>
having senses guarded and mind protected,<br>
not filled with desire, not burning <span class='add'>as though fire,</span><br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw119'></a> Discarding the attributes of household life,<br>
just like a coral tree with fallen-off leaves,<br>
departing <span class='add'>the house</span> wearing the saffron robe,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw38'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw120'></a> Not greedy for <span class='add'>good</span> tastes, not wavering, not<br>
feeding others, on unbroken begging rounds,<br>
with a mind that’s not bound to this clan or that,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw39'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw121'></a> Abandoning the five hindrances of mind,<br>
having pushed away all of the defilements,<br>
independent, affection <span class='add'>and</span> hate removed,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw40'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw122'></a> Putting happiness and suffering behind,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> even in the past, mental joy and pain;<br>
attaining equanimity, calm and pure,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw41'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw123'></a> With strenuous effort to reach the best goal,<br>
with mind unstuck <span class='add'>and</span> behavior attentive,<br>
with firm exertion, having strength and power,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw42'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw124'></a> Not quitting solitude <span class='add'>or</span> meditation,<br>
always living among things by the Teaching,<br>
grasping the danger within existences,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw43'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw125'></a> Aspiring to destroy craving, not lazy,<br>
not foolish, learned, possessing mindfulness,<br>
probing the Teaching, restrained, energetic,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw44'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw126'></a> Not terrified, like a lion <span class='add'>hearing</span> sounds;<br>
unentangled, as is the wind in a net;<br>
not smeared, like a pink lotus by the water,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw45'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw127'></a> Having overcome, like a strong-toothed lion,<br>
the king of beasts, wandering victorious,<br>
one should make use of lodgings that are remote,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw46'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw128'></a> Practicing love, equanimity, pity,<br>
release, or joy for others at the <span class='add'>right</span> time,<br>
being unobstructed by the entire world,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw47'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw129'></a> Quitting passion and hatred and delusion,<br>
having broken to bits <span class='add'>one’s own</span> hindrances,<br>
not trembling at the moment when life’s destroyed,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw48'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw130'></a> They associate, they embrace with <span class='add'>some</span> motive;<br>
friends without motives are hard to find these days.<br>
Wise about self-interest, people aren’t pure.<br>
One should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw49'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw131'></a> With Pure Morals and With Very Pure Wisdom,<br>
Attentive, Applying Selves to Mindfulness,<br>
Insightful, Seeing the Teaching’s Distinction,<br>
Knowing the Aspects of Path <span class='add'>and</span> of Wisdom, <a class='vjw' id='vjw50'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw132'></a> in a Victor’s dispensation practicing<br>
merit, aspiration <span class='add'>and</span> thus <span class='add'>gaining</span> signs,<br>
Wise Ones who don’t go on to have followers<br>
become Lonely Victors, <span class='add'>those</span> Self-Become Ones. <a class='vjw' id='vjw51'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw133'></a> With Vast <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>, <span class='add'>and</span> Many <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-Bodies,<br>
Mind-Lords, Crossing the Flood of All Suffering,<br>
With Thrilled Minds, Seers of the Ultimate Goal,<br>
Analogues of Lions, Like a Rhino’s Horn, <a class='vjw' id='vjw52'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw134'></a> With Tranquil Senses, With Tranquil Minds, Composed,<br>
Acting Mindfully for neighboring beings,<br>
Lamps shining the light of ultimate truth here,<br>
these Lonely Buddhas are constantly honored. <a class='vjw' id='vjw53'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw135'></a> All Obstacles Abandoned, Lords of People,<br>
Lamps of the World, Shedding Light Like Heaps of Gold,<br>
Free of Doubt <span class='add'>and</span> Good for the World to Look At,<br>
these Lonely Buddhas are constantly honored. <a class='vjw' id='vjw54'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw136'></a> The clever sayings of the Lonely Buddhas<br>
are circulating in the world with <span class='add'>its</span> gods.<br>
Having heard, those who don’t act that way are fools;<br>
they spin in suffering again and again. <a class='vjw' id='vjw55'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw137'></a> The clever sayings of the Lonely Buddhas<br>
are as sweet as if they were flowing honey.<br>
Having heard, those who practice accordingly<br>
become seers of the <span class='add'>Four</span> Truths, very wise. <a class='vjw' id='vjw56'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw138'></a> The<span class='add'>se</span> lofty verses spoken by <span class='add'>those</span> Victors,<br>
Lonely Buddhas, gone forth into homelessness,<br>
were made known, for apprehending the Teaching,<br>
by the Śākyan Lion, the Ultimate Man. <a class='vjw' id='vjw57'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw139'></a> With pity for the world, these transformations<br>
of those <span class='add'>Self-Become Ones,</span> the Lonely Buddhas,<br>
were made known by <span class='add'>him,</span> the Self-Become Lion,<br>
for increasing emotion and connection. <a class='vjw' id='vjw58'></a></p>
