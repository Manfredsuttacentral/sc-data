<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw920'></a> In the city, Candavatī,<br>
I was waiting on my parents.<br>
I constantly provided for<br>
my blind mother and father <span class='add'>there</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw921'></a> Gone off alone and sitting down<br>
this thought occurred to me back then:<br>
“while providing for my parents<br>
I cannot <span class='add'>yet</span> renounce the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw922'></a> Being shrouded in dark blindness<br>
I’m being scorched by the three fires.<br>
Though in such straits, <span class='add'>and now</span> afraid,<br>
there is no one <span class='add'>who can</span> guide <span class='add'>me</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw923'></a> The Buddha’s been born in the world;<br>
the Victor’s dispensation shines.<br>
The Self can <span class='add'>now</span> be moved beyond<br>
by people <span class='add'>who do</span> good karma. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw924'></a> Taking up the Three Refuges<br>
I’ll <span class='add'>henceforth</span> guard them completely.<br>
Through that karma which is done well<br>
I will be released from ill-states.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw925'></a> The Buddha’s foremost follower<br>
was the monk known as Nisabha.<br>
After going up to that <span class='add'>monk</span><br>
I took the three-fold refuge <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw926'></a> In those days the normal lifespan<br>
<span class='add'>numbered</span> one hundred thousand years.<br>
For all that time I did protect<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> taking refuge totally. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw927'></a> When <span class='add'>my</span> last <span class='add'>breath</span> was taking place,<br>
I remembered that refuge <span class='add'>then</span>.<br>
Through that karma which was done well<br>
I went on to Tāvatiṃsa. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw928'></a> Departed, in the world of gods<br>
well-placed due to <span class='add'>my</span> good karma,<br>
in every region I was born<br>
I received the eight good things <span class='add'>there</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw929'></a> Worshipped in <span class='add'>every</span> direction,<br>
I developed piercing wisdom.<br>
All the gods submitted <span class='add'>to me</span>.<br>
I received food beyond measure. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw930'></a> Everywhere, the color of gold,<br>
I was beloved <span class='add'>by everyone</span>.<br>
Remaining steadfast for my friends,<br>
my glory had achieved great heights. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw931'></a> Eighty times as the king of gods<br>
I exercised divine rule <span class='add'>then</span>.<br>
Anointed by celestial nymphs<br>
I enjoyed <span class='add'>much</span> divine pleasure. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw932'></a> <span class='add'>Full</span> five hundred times I ruled <span class='add'>then</span><br>
as a monarch who turns the wheel,<br>
<span class='add'>and I did have</span> much local rule<br>
innumerable by counting. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw933'></a> When <span class='add'>my</span> last rebirth was attained,<br>
well-placed due to <span class='add'>my</span> good karma,<br>
I was born in a rich family<br>
with a big house in Śrāvasti. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw934'></a> Setting out from that <span class='add'>great</span> city<br>
placed in front by <span class='add'>other</span> children<br>
I approached a monastery<br>
<span class='add'>hoping to find</span> sports and laughter. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw935'></a> There I did see a <span class='add'>Buddhist</span> monk,<br>
set free, and having no desires.<br>
He explained the Teaching to me<br>
and gave me the <span class='add'>three</span> refuges. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw936'></a> After I heard <span class='add'>the word</span> “refuge,”<br>
recalling my <span class='add'>former</span> refuge,<br>
I sat down on a single seat<br>
<span class='add'>and then</span> attained arahantship. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw937'></a> Being <span class='add'>only</span> seven years old<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship.<br>
Knowing virtue, the Eyeful One,<br>
the Sambuddha ordained <span class='add'>me then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw938'></a> Immeasurable aeons hence<br>
I went for the <span class='add'>three-fold</span> refuge.<br>
The fruit <span class='add'>of</span> that karma well done<br>
is afterward shown to me here. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw939'></a> Well-protected was my refuge<br>
firmly established in my mind.<br>
After enjoying all of that<br>
I realized the steadfast state. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw940'></a> Let those of you with ears to hear,<br>
all of you, listen to my words.<br>
I’m declaring as fact to you<br>
that I have seen this state myself. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw941'></a> “The Buddha’s been born in the world;<br>
the Victor’s dispensation shines.<br>
The drum of deathlessness <span class='add'>now</span> sounds,<br>
removing the arrows of grief. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw942'></a> In the unsurpassed merit-field<br>
if you all <span class='add'>now</span> take ownership<br>
with all the strength that you possess,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> you all will see nirvana. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw943'></a> Taking up the three-fold refuge,<br>
guarding the five moral precepts,<br>
pleasing <span class='add'>your</span> heart in the Buddha<br>
you’ll make an end to suffering. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw944'></a> Acting with me as <span class='add'>your</span> model<br>
guarding <span class='add'>all</span> the moral precepts<br>
in a short time, <span class='add'>then</span> all you too<br>
will attain <span class='add'>your</span> arahantship.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw945'></a> Thrice-knowing, with superpowers,<br>
I’m skilled at the reading of minds.<br>
A follower of yours, Wise One<br>
worships the Teacher’s refuges. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw946'></a> I went to Buddha for refuge<br>
uncountable aeons ago.<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of taking refuge. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw947'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
