<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3791'></a> My wife had passed away, my son<br>
had gone to the cemetery;<br>
on a single pyre I had burned<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> mother, father, and brothers. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3792'></a> I was consumed due to that grief,<br>
I had become haggard and pale<br>
and I was mentally deranged,<br>
greatly pained because of that grief. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3793'></a> Wounded by the arrow of grief,<br>
I went up to the forest’s edge.<br>
Eating <span class='add'>only</span> wild fruits <span class='add'>I found</span>,<br>
I dwelt at the foot of a tree. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3794'></a> The Sambuddha named Sumedha,<br>
the Victor, Ender of Dis-ease,<br>
with a desire to lift me up,<br>
did come into my presence <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3795'></a> Having heard the sound of the feet<br>
of Sumedha, the Sage So Great,<br>
I having lifted up <span class='add'>my</span> head<br>
did gaze upon <span class='add'>him</span>, the Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3796'></a> <span class='add'>When he</span>, the Great Hero, approached,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> joy did get produced for me.<br>
Having seen him, the World-Leader,<br>
my mind <span class='add'>at last</span> was put at ease. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3797'></a> Having recovered consciousness,<br>
I gave <span class='add'>him</span> a handful of leaves.<br>
The Blessed One <span class='add'>then</span> sat down there,<br>
out of compassion, Eyeful One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3798'></a> Sitting down there, the Blessed One,<br>
Sumedha, Leader of the World,<br>
Buddha preached to me the Teaching<br>
that removes the arrows of grief: <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3799'></a> “Uninvited <span class='add'>they’ve</span> come from there;<br>
not taking leave <span class='add'>they’ve</span> gone from here.<br>
As <span class='add'>they</span> have come, so <span class='add'>they</span> have gone;<br>
what <span class='add'>good</span> is wailing about that? <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3800'></a> Just as, when rain is raining down,<br>
people traveling on the road,<br>
taking their goods, are going to<br>
<span class='add'>a place where</span> the rain’s not falling, <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3801'></a> and when the rain has ceased <span class='add'>to fall,</span><br>
they carry on as they had planned;<br>
thus your mother <span class='add'>and</span> father <span class='add'>too</span>:<br>
what <span class='add'>good</span> is wailing about that? <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3802'></a> <span class='add'>We’re all</span> visiting strangers, guests,<br>
wavering, driven on, shaken.<br>
Thus your mother <span class='add'>and</span> father <span class='add'>too</span>:<br>
what <span class='add'>good</span> is wailing about that? <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3803'></a> Just as a serpent slithers on,<br>
abandoning its worn-out skin,<br>
thus your mother <span class='add'>and</span> father <span class='add'>too</span>:<br>
their bodies are abandoned here.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3804'></a> Understanding the Buddha’s words,<br>
I removed the arrow of grief.<br>
Generating happiness, I<br>
worshipped the Best of the Buddhas. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3805'></a> Worshipping the Great Elephant,<br>
I offered Sumedha, Leader<br>
of the World, a stalk of flowers<br>
endowed with a heavenly scent. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3806'></a> Having worshipped the Sambuddha,<br>
pressing my hands upon <span class='add'>my</span> head,<br>
calling to mind <span class='add'>his</span> chief virtues,<br>
I praised the Leader of the World: <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3807'></a> “Great Hero, you’re the One Who’s Crossed,<br>
Omniscient One, the World-Leader.<br>
You are lifting up all creatures<br>
with <span class='add'>your</span> knowledge, O Sage So Great. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3808'></a> You cut off all perplexity<br>
and also doubt, O Sage So Great.<br>
You’re imparting the path to me<br>
through your knowledge, O Eyeful One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3809'></a> Arahants with the goal attained,<br>
six-knowledge-holders, powerful,<br>
wise ones who travel in the sky,<br>
are surrounding you all the time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3810'></a> <span class='add'>Your</span> followers are bearing fruit,<br>
those attained and those being trained;<br>
your followers are blossoming<br>
like lotus <span class='add'>flowers</span> at sunrise. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3811'></a> As the ocean is unperturbed,<br>
unequaled, difficult to cross,<br>
thus <span class='add'>too</span> are you, O Eyeful One,<br>
Endowed with Knowledge, Infinite.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3812'></a> Having worshipped the World’s Victor,<br>
the Eyeful One, he of Great Fame,<br>
praising each of the directions,<br>
crouched over I went off <span class='add'>from there</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3813'></a> Falling from the world of the gods,<br>
transmigrating from birth to birth,<br>
I came out of <span class='add'>my</span> mother’s womb,<br>
attentive <span class='add'>and</span> remembering. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3814'></a> Having departed from the house,<br>
I went forth into homelessness.<br>
Zealous, also intelligent,<br>
I pastured in meditation. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3815'></a> Having put forth <span class='add'>great</span> exertion,<br>
having gladdened the Sage So Great,<br>
I thereafter am wandering,<br>
like the moon freed from a cloud-bank. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3816'></a> I’m <span class='add'>now</span> intent on seclusion,<br>
calmed, devoid of grounds for rebirth;<br>
knowing well all the defilements,<br>
I am <span class='add'>now</span> living, undefiled. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3817'></a> In the thirty thousand aeons<br>
since I worshipped the Buddha <span class='add'>then</span>,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3818'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
All defilements are exhausted;<br>
now there will be no more rebirth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3819'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3820'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
