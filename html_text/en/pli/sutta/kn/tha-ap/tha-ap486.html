<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5076'></a> My well-made hermitage was <span class='add'>there,</span><br>
in the southern Himalayas.<br>
Searching for ultimate meaning,<br>
I’m then living in the forest. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5077'></a> Satisfied with roots and with fruit,<br>
whether <span class='add'>I</span> receive <span class='add'>them</span> or not,<br>
searching for a <span class='add'>proper</span> teacher,<br>
I am living alone <span class='add'>just then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5078'></a> The Sambuddha named Sumedha<br>
arose in the world at that time.<br>
<span class='add'>While</span> preaching the Four Noble Truths;<br>
he ferried many folks across. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5079'></a> I did not hear of the Buddha,<br>
and no one told me <span class='add'>about him</span>.<br>
When the eighth year had elapsed, I<br>
heard <span class='add'>of</span> the Leader of the World. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5080'></a> After bringing wood for the fire,<br>
having swept out the hermitage,<br>
having taken <span class='add'>my</span> shoulder yoke,<br>
I set out from the forest <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5081'></a> Staying over a single night<br>
in villages and <span class='add'>also</span> towns,<br>
little by little I approached<br>
the <span class='add'>city named</span> Candavatī. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5082'></a> The Buddha in that period<br>
was Sumedha, the World-Leader.<br>
Preaching the state of deathlessness,<br>
he’s lifting up many beings. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5083'></a> Stepping past the mass of people,<br>
worshipping the dispensation,<br>
placing deer-hide on one shoulder<br>
I praised the Leader of the World: <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5084'></a> “You’re the Teacher for those who breathe,<br>
the Banner, the Flag and the Pole;<br>
you are the Goal, the Solid Ground,<br>
the Island, the Best of Bipeds. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5085'></a> The twenty-first Recitation Portion<br>
Sharp in philosophy, Hero,<br>
you ferry the people across.<br>
There’s no other star in the world<br>
that is higher <span class='add'>than you,</span> O Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5086'></a> It is possible to measure<br>
the ocean with a blade of grass,<br>
but not ever could one measure<br>
your knowledge, O Omniscient One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5087'></a> It’s possible to lift the earth<br>
onto a comparable sphere,<br>
but not ever could one measure<br>
your wisdom, O Omniscient One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5088'></a> It’s possible to measure <span class='add'>all</span><br>
space with a rope or by the inch,<br>
but not ever could one measure<br>
your good conduct, Omniscient One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5089'></a> The water in the great ocean,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> space of this <span class='add'>bountiful</span> earth,<br>
are <span class='add'>both things</span> that can be measured;<br>
you’re beyond measure, Eyeful One.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5090'></a> With <span class='add'>those</span> six verses having praised<br>
the Greatly Famed, Omniscient One,<br>
having pressed <span class='add'>both</span> hands together,<br>
I then remained <span class='add'>there</span> silently. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5091'></a> The one whom they call “Sumedha,”<br>
Very Wise <span class='add'>and</span> Intelligent,<br>
seated in the monks’ Assembly,<br>
spoke these verses <span class='add'>about me then</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5092'></a> “This one who has praised my knowledge,<br>
<span class='add'>feeling-</span>well pleased by <span class='add'>his</span> own hands,<br>
I shall relate details of him;<br>
<span class='add'>all of</span> you listen to my words: <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5093'></a> For seventy-seven aeons<br>
he’ll delight in the world of gods.<br>
A thousand times the lord of gods,<br>
he will exercise divine rule. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5094'></a> Also, a different hundred times,<br>
he’ll be a king who turns the wheel.<br>
<span class='add'>And there will be</span> much local rule,<br>
innumerable by counting. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5095'></a> <span class='add'>Whether</span> born human or divine,<br>
being fitted with good karma,<br>
with intentions not lacking thought,<br>
he will be one with sharp wisdom. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5096'></a> In thirty thousand aeons <span class='add'>hence</span>,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5097'></a> Having departed from the house,<br>
he will go forth, having nothing.<br>
Being <span class='add'>only</span> seven years old,<br>
he will attain arahantship.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5098'></a> As far back as I remember,<br>
ever since I reached discretion,<br>
in the interval I don’t know<br>
any thinking that’s not lovely. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5099'></a> Transmigrating, in every life,<br>
I experience good fortune.<br>
I have no lack of possessions:<br>
<span class='add'>that’s</span> the fruit in praising knowledge. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5100'></a> The three fires are blown out in me;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed;<br>
knowing well all the defilements,<br>
I am <span class='add'>now</span> dwelling undefiled. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5101'></a> In the thirty thousand aeons<br>
since I praised <span class='add'>the Buddha’s</span> knowledge,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
<span class='add'>that’s</span> the fruit in praising knowledge. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5102'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5103'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5104'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
