<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6273'></a> In this <span class='add'>present</span> lucky aeon<br>
Brahmā’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,<br>
known by the name of Kassapa,<br>
Best Debater, <span class='add'>Buddha,</span> arose. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6274'></a> Then I, after having gone forth<br>
in the Buddha’s dispensation,<br>
wandering in the holy life<br>
as long as <span class='add'>I</span> lived, fell from there. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6275'></a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6276-6277'></a> Fallen from there, in a forest,<br>
I was <span class='add'>then born as</span> a pigeon.<br>
A Buddhist monk <span class='add'>was</span> living there,<br>
always delighting in trances,<br>
loving-hearted, compassionate,<br>
with a face always greatly pleased,<br>
even-minded, a great hero,<br>
learned in the <span class='add'>four</span> boundless <span class='add'>states</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4-5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6278'></a> In not a long time I trusted<br>
that follower of the Buddha,<br>
whose thoughts were without obstructions,<br>
friendly toward all living beings. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6279'></a> Then whenever <span class='add'>I</span> approached him,<br>
every day he preached the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
and gave <span class='add'>a little of his</span> food<br>
to me, seated before <span class='add'>his</span> feet. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6280'></a> After living <span class='add'>like that</span> back then,<br>
with great love for the Victor’s son,<br>
having died I went to heaven,<br>
like home <span class='add'>after</span> being abroad. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6281'></a> Fallen from heaven I’m reborn<br>
as human due to good karma.<br>
Throwing away <span class='add'>life in</span> the house,<br>
I <span class='add'>then</span> went forth repeatedly. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6282'></a> As monk, ascetic <span class='add'>or</span> brahmin,<br>
I was thus one who had gone forth,<br>
becoming a forest-dweller<br>
<span class='add'>in</span> various hundreds <span class='add'>of lives</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6283'></a> And now in <span class='add'>my</span> final rebirth,<br>
a brahmin <span class='add'>named</span> Vacchagotta<br>
in lovely Kapilavastu,<br>
I set forth along with <span class='add'>my</span> wife. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6284'></a> My mother’s pregnancy craving<br>
<span class='add'>when she was</span> close to giving birth,<br>
resolved <span class='add'>her</span> to live in the woods,<br>
when <span class='add'>I</span> had come out of <span class='add'>her</span> womb. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6285'></a> <span class='add'>My</span> mother then gave birth to me<br>
within a beautiful forest.<br>
As I departed from her womb,<br>
they swaddled me in saffron <span class='add'>cloth</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6286'></a> After that Prince Siddhartha was<br>
born, Banner of the Śākyan Clan.<br>
I became his beloved friend,<br>
held in confidence and honored. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6287'></a> When Beings’ Hardwood departed,<br>
renouncing <span class='add'>all of his</span> vast fame,<br>
after having gone forth as well,<br>
I went to the Himalayas. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6288'></a> Seeing respected Kassapa,<br>
preacher of rigor, in the woods,<br>
hearing the Victor’d arisen,<br>
I approached the Coachman of Men. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6289'></a> He <span class='add'>then</span> preached the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i> to me,<br>
with all of the meanings explained.<br>
Then, going forth <span class='add'>under Buddha,</span><br>
I went to the forest again. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6290'></a> Zealously living there I <span class='add'>then</span><br>
learned the six special knowledges.<br>
O! I have obtained a good gain,<br>
being pitied by <span class='add'>my</span> good friend. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6291'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6292'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6293'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
