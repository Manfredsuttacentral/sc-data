<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4785'></a> Happy, with pleasure in <span class='add'>my</span> heart,<br>
I had a Bodhi-tree shrine made<br>
for Siddhattha, the Blessed One,<br>
the Biped-Lord, the Neutral One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4786'></a> Being reborn in Tusitā,<br>
I live in a house <span class='add'>made of</span> gems.<br>
There’s neither cold nor hot for me;<br>
the wind does not touch my body. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4787-4788'></a> In the fifty-sixth aeon hence<br>
I was a wheel-turning monarch;<br>
my city known as Kāsika,<br>
constructed by Vissakamma,<br>
was spread out for ten leagues <span class='add'>in length,</span><br>
<span class='add'>and it measured</span> eight leagues in width.<br>
No<span class='add'>thing</span> in that city was \[made<br>
of\] sticks <span class='add'>or of</span> vines <span class='add'>or of</span> clay. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3-4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4789'></a> <span class='add'>My</span> palace known as Maṅgala,<br>
constructed by Vissakamma,<br>
<span class='add'>measured</span> a league across <span class='add'>in length,</span><br>
and it was a half a league wide. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4790'></a> <span class='add'>Its</span> eighty-four thousand pillars<br>
were <span class='add'>all made out of solid</span> gold;<br>
the pinnacles were made of gems,<br>
and the roofs were <span class='add'>made of</span> silver. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4791'></a> That house all made of <span class='add'>solid</span> gold,<br>
constructed by Vissakamma,<br>
was occupied by me <span class='add'>back then</span>:<br>
that’s the fruit of giving a shrine. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4792'></a> After enjoying all of that,<br>
in the world of gods <span class='add'>and of</span> men,<br>
today I have reached nirvana,<br>
the peaceful state that’s unexcelled. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4793'></a> In the ninety-four aeons since<br>
I had that Bodhi<span class='add'>-tree-</span>shrine made,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of giving a shrine. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4794'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4795'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4796'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>

<p>Thus indeed Venerable Bodhighariya Thera spoke these verses.</p>
