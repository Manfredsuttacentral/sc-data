<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5727'></a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
was a Master of Everything.<br>
He rose in the space of the world,<br>
like the sun in the autumn sky. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5728'></a> With <span class='add'>his</span> word-rays he awakens<br>
the lotuses <span class='add'>called</span> things to know.<br>
With his thought-rays the Leader cleans<br>
the muck <span class='add'>known as</span> the defilements. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5729'></a> The fame of the rivals is slain,<br>
like firefly-light <span class='add'>by</span> the sun;<br>
he sheds the light of truthfulness<br>
like a gem <span class='add'>reflects</span> the sunlight. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5730'></a> Like the ocean for gems, he is<br>
the future for the virtuous;<br>
like a rain-cloud for living things,<br>
he rains by the cloud of Teaching. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5731-5732'></a> I was a magistrate back then,<br>
in the city named “Haṃsa;”<br>
approaching I heard the Teaching,<br>
of the one named “Superb Lotus,”<br>
who was purifying my mind<br>
<span class='add'>while</span> explaining the virtue of<br>
a follower who’d done the deed,<br>
the admonisher of the monks. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5-6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5733'></a> Delighted, happy, having heard,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> inviting the Thus-Gone-One,<br>
having fed <span class='add'>him</span> with his students,<br>
I aspired <span class='add'>to attain</span> that place. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5734-5735'></a> Then the Greatly Fortunate One,<br>
loudly as a swan or drum, said,<br>
“look at him, a great minister,<br>
skilled in examining <span class='add'>cases</span>,<br>
fallen down in front of my feet,<br>
his body hair growing upward,<br>
rain-cloud-colored <span class='add'>and</span> broad-shouldered,<br>
with pleasant<span class='add'>-looking</span> eyes <span class='add'>and</span> face, <a class='vjw' id='vjw8-9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5736'></a> with an extensive entourage,<br>
bound for kingship, very famous.<br>
With kindliness he is wishing<br>
for the place of this deed-doer. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5737'></a> Because of this alms-giving <span class='add'>done</span><br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
for one hundred thousand aeons<br>
he won’t be born in a bad state. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5738'></a> Divine fortune among the gods;<br>
greatness <span class='add'>when born</span> among humans:<br>
having enjoyed that, through the rest,<br>
he will attain <span class='add'>his</span> nirvana. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5739'></a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5740'></a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
the one whose name is Kappina<br>
will be the Teacher’s follower.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5741'></a> And so, having performed good deeds,<br>
in the Victor’s dispensation,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5742'></a> Having commanded righteously<br>
<span class='add'>both</span> divine and human kingdoms,<br>
I was born close to Benares,<br>
in a clan of servants who weave. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5743'></a> With a following of thousands,<br>
together with <span class='add'>my</span> chief queen, I<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> attended on five hundred<br>
Buddhas enlightened by themselves. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5744'></a> Having fed <span class='add'>them</span> for three months, we<br>
afterward gave <span class='add'>them</span> the three robes.<br>
Fallen from there we all of us<br>
arose among the thirty <span class='add'>gods</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5745'></a> Fallen from there we all came back<br>
to human existence again.<br>
We’re born in Kukkuṭa city,<br>
to the side of Himalaya. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5746'></a> My name <span class='add'>at birth</span> was Kappina;<br>
son of the king, very famous.<br>
The rest were born in a clan of<br>
ministers; they waited on me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5747'></a> The comfort of kingship attained,<br>
I was rich in every pleasure.<br>
Told by merchants, I got to know,<br>
that the Buddha had arisen: <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5748'></a> “A Buddha’s risen in the world;<br>
Unequaled, the Single Person,<br>
he’s declaring the great Teaching:<br>
ultimate, deathless comfort. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5749'></a> And his students are well-engaged,<br>
well-liberated, undefiled.”<br>
After hearing that good word, <span class='add'>and</span><br>
paying respect to the merchants, <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5750-5751'></a> quitting kingship, with ministers,<br>
I left, devoted to Buddha.<br>
Seeing the great Canda River—<br>
full <span class='add'>of water</span> with level banks,<br>
a little rough, without supports,<br>
a rushing current hard to cross—<br>
recalling the Buddha’s virtue,<br>
I got across <span class='add'>it</span> in safety. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24-25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5752'></a> “If <span class='add'>he</span> Crossed the stream of being,<br>
Buddha, Knower, World’s-End-Goer,<br>
due to the truthfulness of that,<br>
let my journey be a success! <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5753'></a> If the Path is going to peace,<br>
and release is peaceful comfort,<br>
due to the truthfulness of that,<br>
let my journey be a success! <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5754'></a> If the monks have crossed the wasteland,<br>
the unsurpassed field of merit,<br>
due to the truthfulness of that,<br>
let my journey be a success!” <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5755'></a> When that truth-wish had been performed,<br>
the water went off from the road.<br>
Thus in safety I crossed over<br>
to the river’s beautiful bank. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5756'></a> I saw the Buddha sitting down,<br>
like the sun <span class='add'>when it</span> is rising,<br>
blazing like a mountain of gold,<br>
shining forth like a tree of lamps, <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5757'></a> surrounded by <span class='add'>his</span> followers<br>
like the moon along with the stars,<br>
like the king of gods raining forth<br>
the gladdening sermon-water. <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5758'></a> Worshipping with the ministers,<br>
I went up to <span class='add'>him</span> on one side,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> then, discerning <span class='add'>what</span> we wished,<br>
the Buddha preached the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i> <span class='add'>there</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5759'></a> Having heard the stainless Teaching,<br>
we <span class='add'>then</span> said <span class='add'>this</span> to the Victor:<br>
“O Great Sage, please <span class='add'>now</span> ordain <span class='add'>us</span>,<br>
we’re disgusted with existence.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5760'></a> “Well-preached, O monks, is the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
for you to make suffering end;<br>
wander forth in celibacy,”<br>
thus <span class='add'>indeed</span> spoke the Seventh Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5761'></a> When that was spoken, all of us<br>
took on the appearance of monks;<br>
we were <span class='add'>all then</span> fully ordained<br>
stream-enterers in the teachings. <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5762'></a> Then going to Jetavana,<br>
the Guide gave instruction <span class='add'>to us</span>.<br>
<span class='add'>Thus</span> instructed by the Victor,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship. <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5763'></a> Thereafter I admonished them,<br>
the thousand monks <span class='add'>along with me</span>.<br>
<span class='add'>Then</span>, because of my instruction,<br>
they too were freed from defilements. <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5764'></a> The Victor, pleased by that virtue,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> placed in that foremost place,<br>
“Among the monk-admonishers,<br>
Kappina’s top,” <span class='add'>he told</span> the folk. <a class='vjw' id='vjw38'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5765'></a> Karma done a hundred thousand<br>
<span class='add'>aeons hence</span> showed me <span class='add'>its</span> fruit here:<br>
well-liberated, arrow-quick,<br>
I have destroyed my defilements. <a class='vjw' id='vjw39'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5766'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw40'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5767'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw41'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5768'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw42'></a></p>
