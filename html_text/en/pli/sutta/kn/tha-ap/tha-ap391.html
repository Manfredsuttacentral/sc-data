<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3326'></a> When Vipassi’s dispensation<br>
<span class='add'>arose</span>, I made a single cave<br>
in Bandhumā, royal city,<br>
for the monks in four directions. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3327'></a> Covering the floor of the cave<br>
with rugs, I dedicated <span class='add'>it</span>.<br>
Happy, with rapture in <span class='add'>my</span> heart,<br>
I then made this aspiration: <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3328'></a> “Were I to please a Sambuddha<br>
and to get to renounce <span class='add'>the world</span>,<br>
I should attain ultimate peace<br>
and the unexcelled nirvana.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3329'></a> Just because of those good roots,<br>
transmigrating ninety aeons,<br>
born as a god or else a man,<br>
I shined, a doer of merit. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3330'></a> As the remainder of that deed,<br>
here in this final existence,<br>
I was born as the only son<br>
of Campa’s foremost millionaire. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3331'></a> Having heard that I had been born,<br>
this was the wish of my father:<br>
“I am giving to this <span class='add'>young</span> boy<br>
an entire two hundred million.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3332'></a> Hair four fingers wide was produced<br>
on the soles of both of my feet.<br>
It was fine and soft to the touch,<br>
beautiful, just like cotton wool. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3333'></a> In the past for ninety aeons,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> this <span class='add'>aeon</span> one more than that,<br>
I’ve not come to know my feet placed<br>
on <span class='add'>any</span> ground that lacks a rug. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3334'></a> The Sambuddha was pleased by me;<br>
I went forth into homelessness.<br>
I have attained arahantship;<br>
cooled off, I am in nirvana. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3335'></a> Appointed by the All-Seer<br>
“foremost among resolute <span class='add'>monks,</span>”<br>
<span class='add'>I’m</span> undefiled, an arahant,<br>
six knowledge-holder, powerful. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3336'></a> In the ninety-one aeons since<br>
I gave <span class='add'>the Buddha</span> that gift then,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of giving a cave. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3337'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3338'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3339'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3340'></a> Soṇa Koṭivisa Thera<br>
in front of the monks’ Assembly,<br>
being asked questions <span class='add'>then</span> answered<br>
on the great Lake Anotatta.</p>
