<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1116'></a> The World’s Great Lord, surrounded by<br>
a thousand <span class='add'>arahants</span> undefiled,<br>
being one bound to solitude<br>
went off into seclusion <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1117'></a> I was dressed in deer-leather <span class='add'>clothes</span>,<br>
carrying a triple rod <span class='add'>there</span>.<br>
<span class='add'>Then</span> I saw the Chief of the World<br>
encompassed by the Assembly. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1118'></a> Placing deer-hide on one shoulder,<br>
hands pressed together on my head,<br>
having worshipped the Sambuddha,<br>
I praised the World-Leader kindly: <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1119'></a> “Just as all birds, crows and so on,<br>
hatched from eggs or <span class='add'>born out of</span> sweat,<br>
born in wombs or viviparous,<br>
always travel across the sky; <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1120'></a> Whatever creatures may exist,<br>
those with and without consciousness,<br>
are all of them included in<br>
the <span class='add'>great</span> knowledge that you possess. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1121'></a> Whatever mountain scents there are<br>
in the supreme Himalaya<br>
they all can’t match even a bit<br>
<span class='add'>the scent</span> of your morality. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1122'></a> This world together with its gods<br>
is grasped by the darkness-makers.<br>
When your knowledge is shining forth<br>
the darkness-makers are destroyed. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1123'></a> Just as creatures are in the dark<br>
when the sun has set <span class='add'>for the day</span>,<br>
this world’s enshrouded in darkness<br>
when a Buddha has not appeared. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1124'></a> Just as the sun when it rises<br>
drives away darkness every day,<br>
so too do you, O Best Buddha,<br>
destroy the darkness every day. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1125'></a> You are one bent on exertion,<br>
Buddha in the world with <span class='add'>its</span> gods.<br>
Through their delight in your karma<br>
you satisfy many people.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1126'></a> <span class='add'>Then</span> giving thanks for all of that,<br>
the Great Sage Padumuttara,<br>
the Hero, flew into the sky<br>
just like a swan-king in the air. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1127'></a> Having flown off, the Sambuddha,<br>
the Great Sage Padumuttara,<br>
the Teacher, standing in the sky,<br>
spoke these verses <span class='add'>about me then</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1128'></a> “I shall relate details of him<br>
who has made this praise of knowledge,<br>
combined with <span class='add'>good</span> analogies;<br>
<span class='add'>all of</span> you listen to my words: <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1129'></a> Eighteen <span class='add'>different</span> times he will be<br>
the king over <span class='add'>all of</span> the gods.<br>
He will reside upon the earth<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> have three hundred earthly reigns. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1130'></a> <span class='add'>Full</span> five hundred times he will reign,<br>
a king who turns the wheel <span class='add'>of law</span>,<br>
<span class='add'>and he will have</span> much local rule<br>
innumerable by counting. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1131'></a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1132'></a> Having fallen from Tusitā,<br>
incited by <span class='add'>his</span> wholesome roots,<br>
a low ascetic with dreadlocks,<br>
he will be known as Upāli. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1133'></a> And afterwards, having gone forth,<br>
driving away <span class='add'>every</span> evil,<br>
knowing well all the defilements,<br>
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1134'></a> And the Śākyas’ Son, Greatly Famed,<br>
the Buddha known as Gotama,<br>
pleased by his <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Vinaya</i> knowledge<br>
will place him in that foremost place.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1135'></a> I, after going forth with faith,<br>
did <span class='add'>my duty</span>, am undefiled.<br>
Knowing well all the defilements,<br>
without defilements I <span class='add'>now</span> live. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1136'></a> The Blessed One did pity me;<br>
I am skilled in the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Vinaya</i>.<br>
Delighted by my own karma<br>
I’m living without defilements. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1137'></a> Self-controlled in monastic rules<br>
and in the five organs of sense,<br>
I carry all the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Vinaya</i><br>
entirely, that gemstone-mine. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1138'></a> And then, discerning my virtue,<br>
the Teacher, the Best in the World,<br>
seated in the monks’ Assembly,<br>
did place me in that foremost place. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1139'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
