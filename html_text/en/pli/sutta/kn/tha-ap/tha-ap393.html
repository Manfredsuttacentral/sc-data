<p><a class='jw' id='jw3374'></a> In the city, Haṃsavatī,<br>
I was a gate-keeper back then.<br>
Undisturbable, boundless wealth<br>
was heaped up for me in the house. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3375'></a> <span class='add'>While</span> sitting down in solitude,<br>
having <span class='add'>greatly</span> gladdened <span class='add'>my</span> mind,<br>
seated in the splendid palace,<br>
I contemplated thus back then: <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3376'></a> “Much wealth has been obtained by me;<br>
I have an opulent harem.<br>
King Ānanda, lord of the earth,<br>
himself invited <span class='add'>me to come</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3377'></a> And <span class='add'>now</span> this Buddha has been born,<br>
the Spontaneously Born Sage.<br>
And <span class='add'>all this</span> wealth exists for me;<br>
I will give gifts to the Teacher. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3378'></a> The royal prince, <span class='add'>named</span> Paduma,<br>
gave splendid gifts for the Victor:<br>
strong elephants and palanquins<br>
and large supports <span class='add'>to hold them up</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3379'></a> I’ll also give gifts to the monks<br>
with virtue supremely splendid.<br>
I will be the instigator<br>
of other <span class='add'>things</span> not yet given.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3380'></a> Thinking through varied donations<br>
of which the fruit is happiness,<br>
I lit on a requisites-gift,<br>
<span class='add'>which would</span> fulfill my intentions: <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3381'></a> “I shall donate the requisites<br>
for the monks of splendid virtue.<br>
I will be the instigator<br>
of other <span class='add'>things</span> not yet given.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3382'></a> Approaching the basket-makers,<br>
I made an umbrella to last,<br>
bringing together into one,<br>
a hundred thousand umbrellas. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3383'></a> I brought together into one,<br>
a hundred thousand <span class='add'>strips of</span> cloth,<br>
I brought together into one,<br>
a hundred thousand begging bowls. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10a-b'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3384'></a> And also small knives <span class='add'>and</span> hatchets,<br>
needles <span class='add'>and</span> clippers for the nails.<br>
Having <span class='add'>them</span> made fit for that I<br>
hung <span class='add'>them</span> beneath the umbrella. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10c-d,.11a-b'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3385'></a> I had fans made fit for that <span class='add'>too</span>,<br>
fans <span class='add'>made out</span> of palmyra <span class='add'>fronds</span>,<br>
peacock-feathers and tails of yaks;<br>
water-strainers, oil-containers. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11c-d,.12a-b'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3386'></a> I likewise had made, fit for that,<br>
needle-cases <span class='add'>and</span> shoulder straps<br>
as well as girdles for the waist<br>
and <span class='add'>also</span> well-constructed stools. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12c-d,.13a-b'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3387'></a> Filling vessels made for eating<br>
and also copper <span class='add'>oil</span> beakers<br>
with medicines, I fixed those too<br>
on the umbrella’s underside. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13b-c,.14a-b'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3388'></a> I filled vessels with all <span class='add'>of this</span>:<br>
sweet-flag, cuscus grass, licorice,<br>
pepper, also black peppercorns,<br>
myrobalan <span class='add'>and</span> ginger <span class='add'>too</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14c-d,.15a-b'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3389'></a> I likewise had made, fit for that,<br>

sewn with <span class='add'>cloth</span> of the five colors. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16c-d,.17a-b'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3391'></a> I likewise had made, fit for that,<br>
bandages and <span class='add'>also</span> smoke-tubes,<br>

and baskets <span class='add'>woven</span> of wicker. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17c-d,.18a-b'></a></p>

and tools for removing ear-wax. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18c-d,.19a-b'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3393'></a> I <span class='add'>likewise</span> had made, fit for that,<br>
and fixed beneath <span class='add'>that</span> umbrella,<br>
long benches as well as short chairs<br>
and couches fashioned with four <span class='add'>legs</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19c-d,.20a-b'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3394'></a> I likewise had made, fit for that,<br>
wool cushions and cotton cushions,<br>

and very well made pillows <span class='add'>too</span>; <a class='vjw' id='vjw20c-d,.21a-b'></a></p>

small cases, planks and needles <span class='add'>too</span>,<br>
and a bed that was spread with rugs, <a class='vjw' id='vjw21c-d,.22a-b'></a></p>

abundant salt and sour gruel,<br>

<p><a class='jw' id='jw3400-3401'></a>incense, lumps of boiled rice, and rags,<br>
napkins with which to wipe the face:<br>
whatever ought to be given<br>
which is fitting for the Teacher,<br>
after assembling all of that<br>
I went up to <span class='add'>King</span> Ānanda.<br>
After going up to the king,<br>
the father of the Greatest Sage,<br>
having saluted with <span class='add'>my</span> head,<br>
I spoke these words <span class='add'>to him back then</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw26c-d,.27–28'></a></p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Protagonist:</span></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3402'></a>“Together <span class='add'>we were</span> born <span class='add'>and</span> raised;<br>
<span class='add'>we</span> are both of a single mind,<br>
and in common <span class='add'>we</span> both follow<br>
<span class='add'>one course</span> through happiness and pain.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><span class='speaker'>King:</span></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3403'></a>“O conqueror of foes you have<br>
dissatisfaction in the mind.<br>
If you can, warrior, you should<br>
remove that dissatisfaction. <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3404'></a> Your dissatisfaction is mine;<br>
<span class='add'>we</span> are both of a single mind.<br>
Know mine as ‘eliminated’<br>
if yours <span class='add'>has been expelled as well</span>.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Protagonist:</span></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3405'></a>“Know of me, O great king, that my<br>
suffering is hard to remove.<br>
<span class='add'>If you’re</span> able you should shout <span class='add'>it</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3406'></a>one boon hard for you to grant <span class='add'>me</span>.”</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>King:</span></p>
<p>“As long as <span class='add'>I have</span> victory,<br>
to the <span class='add'>whole</span> extent of my life,<br>
if it would be useful to you,<br>
without wavering I’ll give <span class='add'>it</span>.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Protagonist:</span></p>
“This has been roared by you O king,<br>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3407'></a><span class='add'>but</span> too much roaring would be wrong.”</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>King:</span></p>
<p>“Today I’ll recognize you as<br>
the one supported in all things.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Protagonist:</span></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3408'></a>“<span class='add'>When</span> you know <span class='add'>what</span> I <span class='add'>want to</span> give<br>
you’ll obdurately put <span class='add'>me</span> down.”</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>King:</span></p>
<p>“What’s the point of me stopping you?<br>
You should declare your wish to me!” <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Protagonist:</span></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3409'></a>“I am desirous, O great king,<br>
of feeding <span class='add'>him</span>, the Sambuddha,<br>
the Best Buddha, the Unexcelled;<br>
do not let my life be wasted!” <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><span class='speaker'>King:</span></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3410'></a>“I’ll give a different boon to you:<br>
the Thus-Gone-One’s not to be begged;<br>
to no one should the Thus-Gone-One<br>
be given, like a wishing-gem.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Protagonist:</span></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3411'></a>“O king did you not <span class='add'>just</span> say <span class='add'>that</span><br>
you’d even <span class='add'>give me</span> your own life?<br>
The Thus-Gone-One is fit to give<br>
by one giving <span class='add'>his very</span> life.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw38'></a></p>
<p><span class='speaker'>King:</span></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3412'></a>“The Great Hero is kept apart;<br>
to no one should he be given.<br>
The Buddha’s not promised by me;<br>
choose limitless riches <span class='add'>instead</span>.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw39'></a></p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Protagonist:</span></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3413'></a>“Let us arrive at a judgement;<br>
we’ll question in a court of law.<br>
They will declare the proper path;<br>
we will inquire about it thus.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw40'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3414'></a> Having taken the king in hand,<br>
I <span class='add'>then</span> went to the court of law.<br>
<span class='add'>There</span>, in front of <span class='add'>all</span> the judges,<br>
I spoke these words <span class='add'>to them back then</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw41'></a></p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Protagonist:</span></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3415'></a>“Listen to me, O <span class='add'>you</span> judges:<br>
the king did give a boon to me.<br>
Without excepting anything<br>
he offered even <span class='add'>his own</span> life. <a class='vjw' id='vjw42'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3416'></a> When he had given me <span class='add'>that</span> boon,<br>
I wished for the Best of Buddhas.<br>
The Buddha’s well-given to me;<br>
otherwise I am full of doubt.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw43'></a></p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Judges:</span></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3417'></a>“We’ll listen to <span class='add'>these</span> words of yours<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> of the earth-protecting king.<br>
Listening to the words of both<br>
we shall cut off <span class='add'>all of</span> your doubts. <a class='vjw' id='vjw44'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3418'></a> O king, <span class='add'>did</span> you give everything,\<br>
to this man, all-inclusively,<br>
without excepting anything,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> offer even <span class='add'>your own</span> life?” <a class='vjw' id='vjw45'></a></p>
<p><span class='speaker'>King:</span></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3419'></a>“Fallen into misery, he<br>
requested an unexcelled boon.<br>
Knowing him to be so upset,<br>
I gave <span class='add'>it</span>, all-inclusively.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw46'></a></p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Judges:</span></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3420'></a>“You are defeated <span class='add'>here</span>, O king;<br>
the Thus-Gone-One should be given.<br>
The doubts of both have been cut off;<br>
stand firm in <span class='add'>this,</span> the proper path.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw47'></a></p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Protagonist/narrator:</span></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3421'></a>The king being put in <span class='add'>his</span> place<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> said these <span class='add'>words</span> to the judges:</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>King:</span></p>
<p>“Fair to me too you should return<br>
<span class='add'>him</span>; again I’ll get the Buddha.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw48'></a></p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Judges, to protagonist:</span></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3422'></a>“Having fulfilled your intentions,<br>
after feeding the Thus-Gone-One,<br>
you should return the Sambuddha<br>
to <span class='add'>King</span> Ānanda of <span class='add'>great</span> fame.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw49'></a></p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Protagonist:</span></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3423'></a>Having saluted the judges<br>
and also the king, Ānanda,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> happy, being delighted,<br>
I went up to the Sambuddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw50'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3424'></a> Having approached the Sambuddha,<br>
the Flood-Crosser, the Undefiled,<br>
after saluting with <span class='add'>my</span> head,<br>
I spoke these words <span class='add'>to him back then</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw51'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3425'></a> “Give your consent, O Eyeful One,<br>
causing <span class='add'>my</span> heart to <span class='add'>start</span> laughing;<br>
approach my residence along<br>
with the hundred thousand masters.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw52'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3426'></a> Padumuttara, World-Knower,<br>
Sacrificial Recipient,<br>
the Eyeful One gave <span class='add'>his</span> consent,<br>
discerning what I was thinking. <a class='vjw' id='vjw53'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3427'></a> Perceiving <span class='add'>that he gave</span> consent,<br>
after saluting the Teacher,<br>
happy, with rapture in <span class='add'>my</span> heart,<br>
I went up to my residence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw54'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3428'></a> Assembling friends and ministers<br>
I spoke these words <span class='add'>to them back then</span>:<br>
“I got what’s very hard to get,<br>
just like a wish-fulfilling gem.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw55'></a></p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Friends and Ministers:</span></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3429'></a>“With what <span class='add'>then</span> will we worship him?<br>
The Victor is the Boundless One,<br>
Beyond Compare, Unmatched, Hero,<br>
Unmeasurable, Unequaled.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw56'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3430'></a> And thus also Always the Same,<br>
Without a Second, Bull of Men.<br>
Service that’s hard for you to do<br>
is suitable for the Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw57'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3431'></a> Assembling varied flowers let<br>
us make a floral pavilion.<br>
That is what befits the Buddha;<br>
there will be everything-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw58'></a></p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Protagonist:</span></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3432'></a>I made that pavilion <span class='add'>out of</span><br>
blue lotuses, pink lotuses,<br>
jasmine and <i lang='pli' translate='no'>atimuttaka</i>,<br>
champak and ironwood flowers. <a class='vjw' id='vjw59'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3433'></a> I spread one hundred thousand seats,<br>
<span class='add'>which were</span> shaded with umbrellas.<br>
The meanest seat, <span class='add'>reserved</span> for me,<br>
was superb <span class='add'>and</span> worth one hundred. <a class='vjw' id='vjw60'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3434'></a> I spread one hundred thousand seats,<br>
<span class='add'>which were</span> shaded with umbrellas.<br>
After preparing food and drink,<br>
I announced the time <span class='add'>to begin</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw61'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3435'></a> When I announced <span class='add'>that it was</span> time,<br>
the Great Sage, Padumuttara,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> arrived at my residence<br>
with the hundred thousand masters. <a class='vjw' id='vjw62'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3436'></a> The Supreme Person <span class='add'>then</span> sat down,<br>
with the hundred thousand masters,<br>
on the flowery floral stage<br>
<span class='add'>with</span> the umbrella borne on top. <a class='vjw' id='vjw63'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3437'></a> In proper form and without flaws,<br>
the Eyeful One did <span class='add'>then</span> accept<br>
the hundred thousand umbrellas,<br>
<span class='add'>and too</span> the hundred thousand seats. <a class='vjw' id='vjw64'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3438'></a> Padumuttara, World-Knower,<br>
Sacrificial Recipient,<br>
wishing to ferry me across,<br>
accepted <span class='add'>those things</span>, the Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw65'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3439'></a> One for <span class='add'>every</span> one <span class='add'>of the</span> monks,<br>
I gifted an alms-bowl to each.<br>
They put down <span class='add'>their</span> previous bowls;<br>
I carried to each a bronze bowl. <a class='vjw' id='vjw66'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3440'></a> Seven nights and days the Buddha<br>
sat in the floral pavilion.<br>
Awakening many beings,<br>
he turned the wheel of the Teaching. <a class='vjw' id='vjw67'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3441'></a> While he was preaching his sermon,<br>
eighty-four thousand <span class='add'>beings then</span><br>
beneath the floral pavilion<br>
gained insight into the Teaching. <a class='vjw' id='vjw68'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3442'></a> When the seventh day had arrived,<br>
Padumuttara, the Great Sage,<br>
spoke these verses <span class='add'>to the crowd</span><br>
from his umbrella-shaded seat: <a class='vjw' id='vjw69'></a></p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Padumuttara Buddha:</span></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3443'></a>“I’ll relate details of this man<br>
who gave to me, lacking nothing,<br>
this <span class='add'>most</span> excellent offering;<br>
<span class='add'>all of</span> you listen to my words: <a class='vjw' id='vjw70'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3444'></a> Tusker, solider, chariot, horse:<br>

<p><a class='jw' id='jw3445'></a> Palanquins <span class='add'>too</span>, which have been hitched<br>
to elephants <span class='add'>and</span> to horses,<br>

that’s the fruit of everything-gifts. <a class='vjw' id='vjw72'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3446'></a> <span class='add'>And</span> sixty thousand chariots,<br>

<p><a class='jw' id='jw3447'></a> Sixty thousand instruments <span class='add'>and</span><br>
well-decorated kettle-drums<br>
will constantly make sound for him:<br>

<p><a class='jw' id='jw3448'></a> And women <span class='add'>too, all</span> well-made-up<br>
numbering eight-six thousand,<br>
