<p><a class='jw' id='jw6118'></a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
the One with Eyes for everything,<br>
the Leader <span class='add'>of the World,</span> arose<br>
a hundred thousand aeons hence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6119'></a> Just like the waves on the ocean,<br>
<span class='add'>and just</span> like the stars in the sky,<br>
thus the word of the <span class='add'>Sambuddha,</span><br>
is thought out by the arahants. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6120'></a> The Supreme Victor, in a crowd<br>
mixed with <span class='add'>Buddhist</span> monks and brahmins,<br>
is honored by people along<br>
with the gods, titans and snake-gods. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6121'></a> The Victor, the World-Surpasser,<br>
illuminates the world with rays,<br>
causing to open through his words<br>
the tractable lotus<span class='add'>-people</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6122'></a> The Supreme Person, Endowed with<br>
the Four Perfect Confidences,<br>
Fear <span class='add'>and</span> Timidness Abandoned,<br>
is Confident, with Peace Attained. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6123'></a> The World-Chief is acknowledged as<br>
the entire sphere of Buddhahood,<br>
<span class='add'>which is</span> the Excellent Bull’s place;<br>
there is no one who refutes <span class='add'>that</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6124'></a> When the Neutral One, <span class='add'>the Buddha</span>,<br>
fearlessly roars <span class='add'>his</span> lion’s roar,<br>
no god nor man nor God Himself<br>
exists who contradicts <span class='add'>his words</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6125'></a> Preaching the excellent <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
ferrying <span class='add'>the world</span> with <span class='add'>its</span> gods,<br>
Confident among Multitudes,<br>
he’s turning the wheel of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6126'></a> Praising the lofty virtue of<br>
a well-regarded follower,<br>
foremost among eloquent <span class='add'>monks</span>,<br>
he placed him in that foremost place. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6127'></a> I then <span class='add'>lived</span> in Haṃsavatī,<br>
a brahmin <span class='add'>likewise</span> well-regarded,<br>
born knowing all of the Vedas,<br>
lord of speech, debater-crusher. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6128'></a> Approaching him, the Great Hero,<br>
having heard that <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-preaching,<br>
I obtained overwhelming joy,<br>
loving the follower’s virtue. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6129'></a> Inviting <span class='add'>him</span>, the Well-Gone-One,<br>
World’s Delighter, with Assembly,<br>
I served <span class='add'>them</span> food for seven days,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> then I covered <span class='add'>them</span> with cloth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6130'></a> Bowing with <span class='add'>my</span> head at <span class='add'>his</span> feet,<br>
granted leave, hands pressed together,<br>
happy, standing <span class='add'>off to</span> one side,<br>
I praised the Ultimate Victor: <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6131'></a> “Praise to you, Leopard of Sages!<br>
Praise to you, O Best of People!<br>
Praise to you, Chief of Every World!<br>
Praise to you, Fearlessness-Maker! <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6132'></a> Praise to you, Confuser of Death!<br>
Praise to you, Crusher of <span class='add'>False</span> Views!<br>
Praise to you, Peaceful Comforter!<br>
Praise to you, Gone Beyond Refuge! <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6133'></a> Revered One: Lord for the lordless,<br>
Courage-Giver for the frightened,<br>
Resting Place for the exhausted,<br>
Refuge for those seeking refuge.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6134'></a> Praising the One of Great Virtue,<br>
the Sambuddha, in such-like ways,<br>
I said to the God of Speakers:<br>
“I’m attaining that monk’s station.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6135-6136'></a> He of Limitless Eloquence,<br>
the Blessed One, said at that time:<br>
“This one who worshipped the Buddha<br>
with followers for a week, and<br>
uttered praises of my virtue,<br>
<span class='add'>feeling well-</span>pleased by <span class='add'>his</span> own hands,<br>
is wishing <span class='add'>to attain</span> the place<br>
of the monk who’s god of speakers. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18-19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6137'></a> Very far into the future,<br>
he’ll receive that delightful <span class='add'>place,</span><br>
enjoying, with nothing lacking,<br>
happiness among gods <span class='add'>and</span> men. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6138'></a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6139'></a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
the one whose name is Vaṅgīsa<br>
will be the Teacher’s follower.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6140'></a> After hearing that I was thrilled,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> then for as long as <span class='add'>I</span> lived ,<br>
loving-hearted, I provided<br>
the Thus-Gone-One with requisites. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6141'></a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6142'></a> And now, in <span class='add'>my</span> final rebirth,<br>
I’m born in a mendicant clan.<br>
Birth was behind <span class='add'>me</span> when I was<br>
<span class='add'>only</span> seven years past <span class='add'>my</span> birth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6143'></a> I’m born knowing all the Vedas,<br>
confident among speech-teachers,<br>
lovely-sounding, varied speaker,<br>
trampling out other speeches. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6144'></a> Born in Vaṅga, I’m “Vaṅga Lord,”<br>
or <span class='add'>I’m known as</span> “the lord of words;”<br>
“Vaṅgīsa” <span class='add'>thus</span> became my name,<br>
which is honored throughout the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6145'></a> When I had attained discretion,<br>
still in the first stage of <span class='add'>my</span> youth,<br>
then in lovely Rajgir <span class='add'>city</span><br>
I saw <span class='add'>the monk</span> Sāriputta, <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6146'></a> The Twenty-Fifth Recitation Portion<br>
wandering about for alms food,<br>
bowl in hand, very self-composed,<br>
eyes undistracted, of few words,<br>
not looking <span class='add'>beyond</span> a plough’s length. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6147'></a> Having seen him, being awestruck,<br>
I spoke as was fitting for me,<br>
<span class='add'>in eloquent</span> verses and feet,<br>
free of spots of <span class='add'>mere</span> fleeting thoughts. <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6148'></a> Then he, the wise one, the hero,<br>
spoke back <span class='add'>thus</span> to me in response:<br>
“The one described my Teacher,<br>
the Sambuddha, the World’s Leader.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw31a-b'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6149'></a> <span class='add'>He then</span> made an impassioned speech,<br>
hard to encounter, ultimate.<br>
Pleased by <span class='add'>that</span> colorful speaking<br>
by the neutral <span class='add'>Sāriputta</span>,<br>
bowing with <span class='add'>my</span> head at <span class='add'>his</span> feet,<br>
I said, “give me ordination.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw31c-d,.32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6150'></a> Then he, the one of great wisdom,<br>
led me to the Best of Buddhas.<br>
Bowing with <span class='add'>my</span> head at <span class='add'>his</span> feet,<br>
I sat in the Teacher’s presence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw33a-b'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6151'></a> The Best Debater said to me,<br>
“Vaṅgīsa, do you know any<br>
art at all?” I spoke about it<br>
and <span class='add'>then</span> I said <span class='add'>to him</span> “I know”. <a class='vjw' id='vjw33c-d'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6152'></a> “Through your distinction in knowledge,<br>
if you can, <span class='add'>then now</span> speak about<br>
a dead skull thrown out in the woods,<br>
even <span class='add'>after</span> twelve years <span class='add'>have passed</span>.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6153'></a> When I agreed <span class='add'>saying</span>, “Yes, <span class='add'>Sir,</span>”<br>
he showed three <span class='add'>such dead</span> skulls <span class='add'>to me</span>.<br>
I said that they were <span class='add'>now</span> reborn<br>
in hell, as a man, with the gods. <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6154'></a> At that time the Leader showed <span class='add'>me</span><br>
the skull of a Lonely Buddha.<br>
After that, without a basis,<br>
I requested ordination. <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6155'></a> After going forth, I praised the<br>
Well-Gone-One in this <span class='add'>and</span> that place.<br>
Therefore the monks became annoyed<br>
at me, “he has a poet’s mind.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6156'></a> Therefore in order to test <span class='add'>me</span>,<br>
the Guide, the Buddha said to me:<br>
“Are these verses thoughtful figures,<br>
or are they spoken groundlessly?” <a class='vjw' id='vjw38'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6157'></a> “Hero, I’m not poet-minded;<br>
they are spoken by me with grounds.”<br>
“In that case, <span class='add'>then,</span> O Vaṅgīsa,<br>
you sing your praises of me now.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw39'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6158'></a> At that time I praised the Hero,<br>
the Seventh Sage, with <span class='add'>my</span> verses.<br>
Then at once, <span class='add'>becoming</span> happy,<br>
the Victor placed me as foremost. <a class='vjw' id='vjw40'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6159'></a> Through <span class='add'>my</span> speaking and through <span class='add'>my</span> mind<br>
I then despised <span class='add'>some</span> others who<br>
were well-behaved. Stirred up by that,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship. <a class='vjw' id='vjw41'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6160'></a> “No other one at all is found who’s<br>
foremost among the eloquent<br>
as is this monk <span class='add'>named</span> Vaṅgīsa;<br>
so should you consider <span class='add'>him</span>, monks.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw42'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6161'></a> Karma done a hundred thousand<br>
<span class='add'>aeons hence</span> showed me <span class='add'>its</span> fruit here:<br>
well-liberated, arrow-quick,<br>
I have destroyed my defilements. <a class='vjw' id='vjw43'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6162'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw44'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6163'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw45'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6164'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw46'></a></p>
