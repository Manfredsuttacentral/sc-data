<p><a class='jw' id='jw3581'></a> In the city, Haṃsavatī,<br>
I was in charge of the roadways.<br>
Calling my kinsfolk together,<br>
I spoke these words <span class='add'>to them back then</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3582'></a> “The Buddha’s been born in the world,<br>
the Unsurpassed Field of Merit,<br>
the Foundation for Every World,<br>
Sacrificial Recipient. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>

the rich people and the brahmins,<br>

Vaiśyas as well as the brahmins,<br>
happy, with pleasure in <span class='add'>their</span> hearts,<br>
have formed themselves into a guild. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3586'></a> The cooks <span class='add'>and</span> those who dress the hair,<br>
the bath boys, the garland-makers,<br>
happy, with pleasure in <span class='add'>their</span> hearts,<br>
have formed themselves into a guild. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3587'></a> The dyers, also the weavers,<br>
the tanners, also the bath girls,<br>
happy, with pleasure in <span class='add'>their</span> hearts,<br>

<p><a class='jw' id='jw3588-3589'></a> The fletchers, the leather workers,<br>
carpenters and workers in gold,<br>
tinsmiths, also <span class='add'>makers of</span> mats,<br>
have formed themselves into a guild. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3590'></a>Hired servants <span class='add'>and</span> musicians,<br>
and numerous slaves and servants,<br>
to the extent of their own strength,<br>
have formed themselves into a guild. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3591'></a> Water-bringers, wood-gatherers,<br>

women who sell cakes <span class='add'>or</span> sell fish,<br>
to the extent of their own strength,<br>
have formed themselves into a guild. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3594'></a> Come you all, gathered together,<br>
let us <span class='add'>too</span> form, as one, a group;<br>
let us <span class='add'>now</span> perform service for<br>
the Unsurpassed Field of Merit.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3595'></a> They, having listened to my words,<br>
formed a group <span class='add'>to last</span> for all time<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> built a well-built meeting-hall<br>
for <span class='add'>those in</span> the monks' Assembly. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3596'></a> After dedicating that hall,<br>
elated with a happy mind,<br>
surrounded by all of those <span class='add'>folks,</span><br>
I went up to the Sambuddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3597'></a> Having approached the Sambuddha,<br>
the Lord of the World, Bull of Men,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> worshipping the Teacher’s feet,<br>
I spoke these words <span class='add'>to him back then</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3598'></a> “These three hundred people, Hero,<br>
<span class='add'>together</span> as one <span class='add'>in</span> a group,<br>
have appointed for you, O Sage,<br>
this well-constructed meeting-hall.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3599'></a> The Eyeful One, accepting <span class='add'>it</span><br>
in front of the monks’ Assembly,<br>
<span class='add'>the Buddha</span> spoke these verses <span class='add'>then</span>,<br>
in front of my three hundred <span class='add'>folks</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3600'></a> “Three hundred and this best one too,<br>
conforming <span class='add'>together</span> as one,<br>
having made this <span class='add'>great</span> achievement,<br>
you all are going to enjoy <span class='add'>it</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3601'></a> When <span class='add'>your</span> last rebirth is attained,<br>
you all will achieve nirvana,<br>
the state of coolness, unsurpassed,<br>
unborn, undying peacefulness.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3602'></a> The Buddha prophesied like that,<br>
the Omniscient One, Best of Monks,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> having heard the Buddha’s words,<br>
I declared <span class='add'>my own</span> mental bliss. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3603'></a> For thirty thousand aeons I<br>
delighted in the world of gods.<br>
Five hundred times the lord of gods,<br>
I exercised divine rule <span class='add'>there</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3604'></a> One thousand times I <span class='add'>also</span> was<br>
a king who turns the wheel <span class='add'>of law</span>.<br>
While exercising divine rule<br>
the great gods <span class='add'>all then</span> worshipped <span class='add'>me</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3605-3606'></a> Here, in this human kingdom, <span class='add'>my</span><br>
relatives are my retinue.<br>
When <span class='add'>my</span> last rebirth was attained<br>
there was a brahmin, Vāseṭṭha,<br>
with eight hundred million in wealth;<br>
I was <span class='add'>born as</span> the son of him.<br>
My <span class='add'>given</span> name <span class='add'>at birth</span> was “Sela,”<br>
a master of Vedic science. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24-25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3607-3608'></a> I, wandering about on foot,<br>
waited on by <span class='add'>my</span> own students,<br>
saw Keniya the ascetic<br>
with matted hair, wearing ashes,<br>
prepared to do a sacrifice.<br>
<span class='add'>Having seen him</span> I spoke these words:</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Sela:</span></p>
<p>“Bringing a wife? Going to one?<br>
Or have you invited the king? <a class='vjw' id='vjw26-27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3609'></a> I want to do sacrifices<br>
for brahmins who think like the gods,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> I’m not invited by kings<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> have not found a sacrifice.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Keniya:</span></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3610-3611'></a>“There is no bringing brides for me;<br>
I do not go to brides <span class='add'>either</span>.<br>
The one I’ve invited today<br>
is Best in the world with <span class='add'>its</span> gods,<br>
the Delighter of the Śākyans<br>
who Brings Happiness to Beings<br>
out of Friendship for All Creatures;<br>
these preparations are for him. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29-30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3612'></a> The Bright Hue of Wild Mangosteen,<br>
Incomparable, Unmeasurable,<br>
the Buddha, Unrivaled in Form,<br>
is invited for tomorrow. <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3613'></a> Like beaten <span class='add'>gold</span> atop a forge<br>
<span class='add'>burning bright</span> like cedar charcoal,<br>
the Great Hero’s like lightening bolts—<br>
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3614'></a> Like fire <span class='add'>burning</span> on a mountain,<br>
like the moon on the fifteenth day,<br>
the same color as burning reeds—<br>
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3615'></a> Fearless, Overcomer of Fear,<br>
the Existence-Ender, the Sage,<br>
The Great Hero’s like a lion—<br>
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3616'></a> Skillful in the Buddha’s Teaching,<br>
little to endure from others,<br>
Great Hero’s like an elephant—<br>
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>

the Unmatched, Buddha-elephant,<br>
the Great Hero is like a bull—<br>

<p><a class='jw' id='jw3618'></a> Of Endless Beauty, Boundless Fame,<br>
Bearing all the Various Marks,<br>
the Great Hero is like Indra—<br>
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>

Majestic One, Hard to Approach,<br>
The Great Hero is like Brahmā—<br>
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw38'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3620'></a> Teaching-Reacher, Ten-Powered One,<br>
Master of Surpassing Power,<br>
the Great Hero is like the earth—<br>
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw39'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3621'></a> Full of waves <span class='add'>called</span> morality,<br>
churning knowledge of the Teaching,<br>
the Great Hero is like the sea—<br>
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw40'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3622'></a> Hard to Approach, Hard to Subdue,<br>
Unshaken, Risen Up, Lofty,<br>
the Great Hero’s like Mt. Meru—<br>
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw41'></a></p>

Unmeasurable, Gone to the Top,<br>
the Great Hero is like the sky—<br>

Protection for Refuge-Seekers,<br>

Dispeller of Every Darkness,<br>
the Great Hero is like the sun—<br>
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw46'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3628'></a> Sage, Seer of the Nature of<br>
Emancipations from Objects,<br>
the Great Hero is like the moon—<br>
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw47'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3629'></a> Venerable, Raised up in the World,<br>
Adorned with the Auspicious Marks,<br>
Unmeasurable, the Great Sage—<br>
I’ve invited him, the Buddha.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3630'></a> The One Whose Knowledge is Boundless,<br>
Morality beyond Compare,<br>
whose freedom has no parallel,<br>
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw48'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3631'></a> Whose courage has no parallel,<br>
whose firmness is unthinkable,<br>
he whose exertion is the best—<br>
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw49'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3632'></a> Passion, hatred, stupidity<br>
and every poison is destroyed;<br>
the Great Hero is like a drug—<br>
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw50'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3633'></a> There’s removal of the darkness<br>
of all pain, defilement, disease;<br>
the Great Hero’s like a doctor—<br>
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw51'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3634'></a> “Friend, this sound is hard to obtain,<br>
which has been said <span class='add'>here</span>, “the Buddha”.<br>
Hearing “the Buddha,” “the Buddha,”<br>
you all should be joyful like me.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw52'></a></p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Sela:</span></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3635'></a>Not keeping my joy inside <span class='add'>me</span><br>
it poured forth <span class='add'>to those</span> outside <span class='add'>me</span>.<br>
I, being <span class='add'>full of</span> joyful thoughts,<br>
spoke these words <span class='add'>to him at that time</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw53'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3636'></a> “Well then where is that Blessed One,<br>
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men?<br>
Having gone where will I see <span class='add'>this</span><br>
Giver of the Fruit of Monkhood?” <a class='vjw' id='vjw54'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3637'></a> <span class='add'>He,</span> taking hold of <span class='add'>my</span> right arm,<br>
thrilled, with <span class='add'>his</span> hands pressed together,<br>
showed to me the King of Teachings,<br>
who Removes the Arrows of Grief. <a class='vjw' id='vjw55'></a></p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Keniya:</span></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3638'></a>“Do you see this massive forest,<br>
risen up like a great storm cloud,<br>
dark blue just like collyrium,<br>
as visible as the ocean? <a class='vjw' id='vjw56'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3639'></a> The Buddha <span class='add'>now</span> is dwelling there,<br>
the Untamed-Tamer, the <span class='add'>Great</span> Sage,<br>
instructing those who can be trained,<br>
making known Awakening’s parts.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw57'></a></p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Sela:</span></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3640'></a>Like the thirsty <span class='add'>seeking</span> water,<br>
like the hungry <span class='add'>looking for</span> food,<br>
like a cow greedy for <span class='add'>its</span> calf,<br>
I went in search of the Victor. <a class='vjw' id='vjw58'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3641'></a> Knowing manners and good conduct<br>
I did teach to my own students<br>
going into Buddha’s presence,<br>
restraint in line with the Teaching: <a class='vjw' id='vjw59'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3642'></a> ‘Blessed Ones are Hard to Approach,<br>
like lions wandering alone,<br>
walking carefully, step by step,<br>
come <span class='add'>along after me</span>, O men. <a class='vjw' id='vjw60'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3643'></a> As fearful as a snake’s venom,<br>
like a lion, king of the beasts,<br>
like a rutting tusked elephant,<br>
thus Buddhas are Hard to Approach. <a class='vjw' id='vjw61'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3644'></a> O men, neglecting <span class='add'>any need</span><br>
<span class='add'>that you may have</span> to cough or sneeze,<br>
walking carefully, step by step,<br>
go into the Buddha’s presence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw62'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3645'></a> Buddhas are Hard to Go Up To,<br>
they’re Ones who Relish Solitude,<br>
make Little Sound, Hard to Approach,<br>
Revered <span class='add'>in the world</span> with its gods. <a class='vjw' id='vjw63'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3646'></a> When I am asking <span class='add'>him</span> questions,<br>
or exchanging friendly greetings,<br>
then you all should make little sound;<br>
stand <span class='add'>there</span> as though <span class='add'>you were</span> sages. <a class='vjw' id='vjw64'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3647'></a> Which Great Teaching he is preaching,<br>
peaceful, leading to nirvana,<br>
listen to the meaning with care,<br>
happily hearing the Teaching.’” <a class='vjw' id='vjw65'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3648'></a> Having approached the Sambuddha<br>
I exchanged greetings with the Sage.<br>
<span class='add'>While I was</span> conversing with him,<br>
I looked out for <span class='add'>Great Man’s</span> marks. <a class='vjw' id='vjw66'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3649'></a> I can see thirty of the marks,<br>
doubting only two of the marks:<br>
through his powers the Sage showed me<br>
<span class='add'>his</span> penis enclosed in a sheath. <a class='vjw' id='vjw67'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3650'></a> <span class='add'>And then the Buddha</span> placed his tongue<br>
into <span class='add'>his</span> ear and on his nose.<br>
The Victor touched <span class='add'>his</span> forehead’s tip<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> covered it all <span class='add'>with his tongue</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw68'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3651'></a> I, seeing his auspicious marks,<br>
fulfilling <span class='add'>all</span> the attributes,<br>
concluding that, “he’s a Buddha,”<br>
I went forth with <span class='add'>all</span> my students. <a class='vjw' id='vjw69'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3652'></a> I went forth into homelessness,<br>
together with the three hundred.<br>
When eight months <span class='add'>still</span> had not elapsed,<br>
we all realized nirvana. <a class='vjw' id='vjw70'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3653'></a> Together doing <span class='add'>good</span> karma<br>
for the Unsurpassed Merit-Field,<br>
together we transmigrated,<br>
together we turned <span class='add'>from the world</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw71'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3654'></a> I gave rafters <span class='add'>for that new hall</span>,<br>
remaining within the guild’s rule.<br>
Due to that deed, well done <span class='add'>by me</span>,<br>
I’m receiving eight good results. <a class='vjw' id='vjw72'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3655'></a> I’m worshipped in <span class='add'>all</span> directions,<br>
and I have food that’s ambrosial;<br>
I’m the support of everyone;<br>
I don’t experience terror. <a class='vjw' id='vjw73'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3656'></a> I don’t get <span class='add'>any</span> diseases,<br>
and I protect <span class='add'>my</span> long life-span.<br>
I am one with exquisite skin,<br>
I live in dwellings <span class='add'>that I</span> choose. <a class='vjw' id='vjw74'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3657'></a> Remaining within the guild’s rule,<br>
the rafters I gave <span class='add'>numbered</span> eight.<br>
Following the eighth <span class='add'>I received</span><br>
analysis with Arahantship. <a class='vjw' id='vjw75'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3658'></a> All accomplishments accomplished,<br>
duties complete, defilement-free,<br>
<span class='add'>I</span> am your son <span class='add'>today</span>, Great Sage,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> “Eight Rafters” is <span class='add'>now my</span> name. <a class='vjw' id='vjw76'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3659'></a> Remaining within the guild’s rule,<br>
the pillars I gave <span class='add'>numbered</span> five.<br>
Due to that deed, well done <span class='add'>by me</span>,<br>
I’m receiving five good results. <a class='vjw' id='vjw77'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3660'></a> I remain unshaken by love,<br>
I do not lack for possessions,<br>
I’m one whose words are taken well,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> likewise I cause no offense. <a class='vjw' id='vjw78'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3661'></a> My mind is not out of control,<br>
I’m not shaken by anything,<br>
unstained in the dispensation,<br>
due to that deed, well done <span class='add'>by me</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw79'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3662'></a> I’m respectful, obedient,<br>
duties complete, defilement-free;<br>
I’m your follower, Great Hero,<br>
a venerated monk, O Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw80'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3663'></a> Making a well-made palanquin,<br>
I <span class='add'>then</span> dedicated that hall.<br>
Due to that deed, well done <span class='add'>by me</span>,<br>
I’m receiving five good results. <a class='vjw' id='vjw81'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3664'></a> I’m born in an eminent clan,<br>
I become a very rich man,<br>
I’m one who achieves all success,<br>
I am not plagued with avarice. <a class='vjw' id='vjw82'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3665'></a> In <span class='add'>whichever</span> village <span class='add'>I</span> wish<br>
my palanquin comes to a rest,<br>
by means of that best palanquin,<br>
I travel according to wish. <a class='vjw' id='vjw83'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3666'></a> Because of that palanquin-gift,<br>
I removed all of <span class='add'>my</span> darkness.<br>
Sage, this monk, empowered with all<br>
special knowledges, worships you. <a class='vjw' id='vjw84'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3667'></a> I performed all of <span class='add'>my</span> duties<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> the duties of others <span class='add'>too</span>.<br>
Because of that well-done deed, I<br>
entered the city of no fear. <a class='vjw' id='vjw85'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3668'></a> I gave food <span class='add'>to the Buddha and</span><br>
also <span class='add'>that</span> well-completed hall.<br>
Due to that deed, well done <span class='add'>by me</span>,<br>
I arrived at that best of states. <a class='vjw' id='vjw86'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3669'></a> Those who are tamers in the world,<br>
tame these elephants <span class='add'>and</span> horses.<br>
Employing varied punishments<br>
they tame by means of cruelty. <a class='vjw' id='vjw87'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3670'></a> Not like that, O Great Hero, do<br>
you tame men <span class='add'>and</span> women <span class='add'>here</span>.<br>
Not using force, without weapons,<br>
you tame in the supreme taming. <a class='vjw' id='vjw88'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3671'></a> Praising the virtues of giving,<br>
<span class='add'>you are</span> skilled in preaching, O Sage;<br>
addressing a single question<br>
you freed the three hundred, O Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw89'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3672'></a> We’re tamed by the charioteer,<br>
well-freed, undefiled, empowered<br>
by all the special knowledges,<br>
quenched in destroying the bases. <a class='vjw' id='vjw90'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3673'></a> In the hundred thousand aeons<br>
since I gave that gift at that time,<br>
every fear has been overcome:<br>
that’s the fruit of giving a hall. <a class='vjw' id='vjw91'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3674'></a> My being in Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw92'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3675'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw93'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3676'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw94'></a></p>
