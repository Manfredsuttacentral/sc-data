<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4908'></a> “Who is not pleased after seeing<br>
the God of Gods, the Bull of Men,<br>
shining like a dinner-plate tree,<br>
<span class='add'>when he’s</span> going along the road? <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4909'></a> Who is not pleased after seeing<br>
him shining the light of knowledge,<br>
driving away <span class='add'>all</span> the darkness,<br>
ferrying many folks across? <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4910'></a> Who is not pleased after seeing<br>
the Leader of the World going<br>
with one hundred thousand masters,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> lifting up many beings? <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4911'></a> Who is not pleased after seeing<br>
<span class='add'>him</span> beat the drum of the Teaching,<br>
sounding the roar of a lion,<br>
crushing groups of ford-worshippers? <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4912'></a> Who is not pleased after seeing<br>
<span class='add'>all the gods</span> including Brahmā<br>
come all the way from Brahmā’s world,<br>
asking <span class='add'>Buddha</span> subtle questions? <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4913'></a> Who is not pleased after seeing<br>
<span class='add'>the world</span> with <span class='add'>its</span> gods imploring,<br>
<span class='add'>both</span> hands pressed together for him,<br>
enjoying merit due to that? <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4914'></a> Who is not pleased after seeing<br>
all the people come together,<br>
attending on the Eyeful One?<br>
Invited, he does not waver. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4915'></a> Who is not pleased after seeing<br>
numerous drums bellowing, <span class='add'>and</span><br>
rutting elephants trumpeting,<br>
when he’s entering the city? <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4916'></a> Who is not pleased after seeing<br>
the All-Bright One always shining,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> raised spots becoming level,<br>
when he is going on the road? <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4917'></a> Who is not pleased after seeing<br>
<span class='add'>him</span> instructing every being,<br>
being heard throughout the cosmos,<br>
when the Blessed One is speaking?” <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4918'></a> In the hundred thousand aeons<br>
since I praised the Buddha <span class='add'>like that</span>,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that is the fruit of praising <span class='add'>him</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4919'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4920'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4921'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
