<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4050'></a> I was a deer-hunter back then,<br>
within a grove in the forest.<br>
<span class='add'>While</span> searching after spotted deer,<br>
I saw the Self-Become One <span class='add'>there</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4051'></a> The Sambuddha named Anuraddha,<br>
the Self-Become, Unconquered One,<br>
Seclusion-Lover, the Wise One,<br>
plunged into the forest back then. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4052'></a> Having gathered four sticks of wood,<br>
I placed them in four <span class='add'>corner-</span>spots.<br>
Building a well-built pavilion,<br>
I covered <span class='add'>it</span> with lotus blooms. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4053'></a> Having covered the pavilion,<br>
I greeted the Self-Become One.<br>
Laying aside my bow right there,<br>
I went forth into homelessness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4054'></a> A short time after going forth,<br>
I was afflicted with illness.<br>
Transmigrating through past karma,<br>
I passed away <span class='add'>right then and</span> there. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4055'></a> Bound up with <span class='add'>my</span> former karma,<br>
I went to Tusitā heaven.<br>
There a mansion made out of gold<br>
is produced according to wish. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4056'></a> <span class='add'>My</span> divine carriage stands in wait,<br>
a thousand-horse-yoked vehicle.<br>
Ascending into that carriage,<br>
I travel according to wish. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4057'></a> When I am going out from there,<br>
having been reborn as a god,<br>
a pavilion’s held up for me<br>
a hundred leagues on every side. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4058'></a> I <span class='add'>always</span> nestle on a bed<br>
that’s constantly strewn with flowers.<br>
And from the sky, pink lotuses<br>
are raining <span class='add'>on me</span> all the time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4059'></a> When the rays of light are throbbing,<br>
and the sun’s heat scorches <span class='add'>the world</span>,<br>
the heat is not oppressing me:<br>
that’s the fruit of a pavilion. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4060'></a> I pass beyond <span class='add'>all</span> bad rebirth;<br>
the states of woe are closed to me.<br>
In a pavilion or tree-root,<br>
burning heat is not known by me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4061'></a> Fixing perception on the earth,<br>
I cross over the <span class='add'>great</span> ocean.<br>
That’s my well-done karma, the fruit<br>
of <span class='add'>doing</span> that Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4062'></a> Making roads, even with no road,<br>
I am traveling in the sky.<br>
O! that karma well-done by me:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4063'></a> I know former existences,<br>
the “divine eye” is purified,<br>
my defilements are <span class='add'>all</span> destroyed:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4064'></a> Buddha’s legitimate offspring,<br>
worthy heir to the Great Teaching,<br>
I’ve renounced my earlier birth:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4065'></a> I’m one who pleased the Well-Gone-One,<br>
Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,<br>
the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s heir, I bear its flag:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4066'></a> After serving the Sambuddha,<br>
Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,<br>
I asked the Leader of the World<br>
<span class='add'>about</span> the path that goes beyond. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4067'></a> Being asked, the Buddha <span class='add'>then</span> told<br>
the deep and subtle state <span class='add'>beyond</span>.<br>
Having heard that Teaching of his,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4068'></a> O! that karma well-done by me!<br>
I’m fully freed from being born;<br>
I have destroyed all defilements;<br>
now there will be no more rebirth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4069'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4070'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4071'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
