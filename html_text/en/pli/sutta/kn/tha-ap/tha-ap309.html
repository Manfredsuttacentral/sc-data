<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2748-49'></a>A garden was planted by me<br>
for Siddhattha, the Blessed One.<br>
When birds were roosting in the trees<br>
<span class='add'>and they’d come to produce</span> thick shade,<br>
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,<br>
Sacrificial Recipient.<br>
I brought the Best One in the World,<br>
the Bull among Men, to the garden. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1-2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2750'></a> Happy, <span class='add'>and</span> with a happy heart,<br>
I gave fruits and flower<span class='add'>s</span> <span class='add'>to him</span>,<br>
and with the pleasure born of that,<br>
I made the formal donation. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2751'></a> That which I gave to the Buddha,<br>
with a mind that was very clear,<br>
was reborn as <span class='add'>great</span> fruit for me while<br>
I was reborn in existence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2752'></a> In the ninety-four aeons since<br>
I gave <span class='add'>him</span> that gift at that time,<br>
I’ve come to no know bad rebirth:<br>
the fruit of giving a garden. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2753'></a> In the thirty-seventh aeon<br>
were seven Mudusītalas,<br>
wheel-turning monarchs with great strength,<br>
possessors of the seven gems. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2754'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>

<p>Thus indeed Venerable Ārāmadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.</p>
