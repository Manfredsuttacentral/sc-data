<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4943'></a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
was a Master of Everything,<br>
Seclusion-Lover, the Sambuddha<br>
was flying through the sky <span class='add'>back then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4944'></a> In the Himalayan region,<br>
there was a large natural lake.<br>
My palace was <span class='add'>located</span> there,<br>
bound up with <span class='add'>my</span> good karma. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4945'></a> Having gone out from the palace,<br>
I saw the Leader of the World,<br>
bright like a blue water lily,<br>
blazing up like a fire-altar. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4946'></a> <span class='add'>Thinking,</span> “I’ll worship the Leader,”<br>
<span class='add'>though</span> I searched I saw no flower.<br>
Bringing pleasure to <span class='add'>my</span> own heart,<br>
I worshipped <span class='add'>him</span>, the Teacher, <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4947'></a> With the gem <span class='add'>I had</span> on my head,<br>
I worshipped <span class='add'>him</span>, the World-Leader:<br>
“Let there be a lucky result<br>
of this offering of a gem.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4948'></a> Padumuttara, World-Knower,<br>
Sacrificial Recipient,<br>
the Teacher, standing in the sky,<br>
spoke this verse <span class='add'>about me then</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4949'></a> “Let your thought have a good result;<br>
let you receive huge happiness.<br>
Because of offering this gem,<br>
let you experience great fame.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4950'></a> Having said this, the Blessed One,<br>
the one whose name was “Best Lotus,”<br>
the Best Buddha <span class='add'>then</span> flew away,<br>
to where <span class='add'>his</span> mind directed <span class='add'>him</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4951'></a> Sixty aeons the lord of gods,<br>
I exercised divine rule.<br>
And another hundred times I<br>
was a monarch who turns the wheel. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4952'></a> When I had become a god who<br>
remembered <span class='add'>his</span> former karma,<br>
a gemstone comes to be for me,<br>
<span class='add'>which functioned as</span> my source of light. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4953-4954'></a> Eighty-six thousand women <span class='add'>then</span><br>
were <span class='add'>married to me as</span> my wives,<br>
with varied clothes and jewelry<br>
and wearing earrings made of gems,<br>
with long eyelashes, lovely smiles<br>
and slim waists, pleasant to look at.<br>
<span class='add'>They’re</span> constantly waiting on me:<br>
that’s the fruit of offering gems. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11-12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4955'></a> Well-made things to adorn <span class='add'>myself</span><br>
are <span class='add'>coming</span> to me as I wish,<br>
made of gold and made of gemstones,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> likewise made out of rubies. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4956'></a> Delightful gabled huts and caves,<br>
and beds that are very costly,<br>
discerning what I am thinking,<br>
are produced according to wish. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4957'></a> The gain for them is well-received<br>
who get to listen <span class='add'>to Buddha,</span><br>
the Merit-Field for humankind,<br>
the Medicine for all that breathe. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4958'></a> My karma too was <span class='add'>so</span> well done,<br>
which is that I saw the Leader.<br>
I am freed from <span class='add'>all</span> suffering;<br>
<span class='add'>I’ve</span> attained the unshaking state. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4959'></a> In whichever womb I’m reborn,<br>
<span class='add'>whether</span> it’s human or divine,<br>
on all sides are the seven gems;<br>
there is light for me all the time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4960'></a> Because of that gem-offering,<br>
having enjoyed <span class='add'>great</span> good fortune,<br>
the knowledge-light is seen by me;<br>
I’ve attained the unshaking state. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4961'></a> In the hundred thousand aeons<br>
since I offered that gem <span class='add'>to him</span>,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of offering gems. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4962'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4963'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4964'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
