<h1>387. {390.} The Rags of Previous Karma</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3341'></a> Near the lake called Anotatta,<br>
on the lovely level rock ground,<br>
where sparkled gems of different sorts<br>
and varied perfumes <span class='add'>filled</span> the woods, <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3342'></a> surrounded by the Assembly<br>
of monks, the Leader of the World,<br>
while seated there, did <span class='add'>then</span> explain<br>
the former deeds done by himself: <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3343'></a> Hear from me, O monks, the karma<br>
<span class='add'>which formerly was</span> done by me,<br>
<span class='add'>and how</span> those karma rags’ <span class='add'>effects</span><br>
ripen in the Buddha himself. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3344'></a> Among <span class='add'>my</span> other, former births<br>
I was a jerk named Munāli.<br>
I told lies about Sarabhu,<br>
an innocent Lonely Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3345'></a> As a result of that karma,<br>
a long time I circled through hell.<br>
I experienced suffering<br>
for numerous thousands of years. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3346'></a> As <span class='add'>its</span> final karmic effect,<br>
here in <span class='add'>my</span> final existence,<br>
I received <span class='add'>some nasty</span> slander<br>
connected with Sundarīkā. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3347'></a> I was Nanda, a follower<br>
of the Buddha Sabbābhibhu.<br>
My transmigration was in hell<br>
for long after I slandered him. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3348'></a> My long transmigration in hell<br>
<span class='add'>continued for</span> ten thousand years.<br>
When I <span class='add'>again</span> got human birth,<br>
I <span class='add'>also</span> got lots of slander. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3349'></a> Through what remained of that karma,<br>
Lady Ciñca did slander me<br>
in front of a group of people<br>
without any grounding in fact. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3350'></a> I was an erudite brahmin,<br>
attended on, given worship.<br>
In a large wood, I was teaching<br>
mantras to five hundred young men. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3351'></a> To that place had come Sage Gīma,<br>
who possessed vast superpowers.<br>
After having seen him coming,<br>
I slandered that blameless <span class='add'>person</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3352'></a> I said <span class='add'>this</span> to my students then:<br>
“this sage delights in the pleasures!”<br>
The young men <span class='add'>there</span> took <span class='add'>that</span> to heart<br>
when I made that declaration. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3353'></a> Then all the young men, <span class='add'>my students</span>,<br>
begging for alms from clan to clan,<br>
repeated to a lot of folks,<br>
“this sage delights in the pleasures!” <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3354'></a> As a result of that karma,<br>
these five hundred monks <span class='add'>now with me</span><br>
all received <span class='add'>some nasty</span> slander<br>
connected with Sundarīkā. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3355'></a> One time eying wealth I murdered<br>
brothers by a second mother.<br>
I put <span class='add'>them</span> on a mountain road<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> crushed <span class='add'>them</span> in an avalanche. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3356'></a> As a result of that karma,<br>
Devadatta threw a boulder<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> a splinter <span class='add'>off that boulder</span><br>
<span class='add'>then</span> crushed the big toe on my foot. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3357'></a> One time I was a little boy,<br>
playing by the great thoroughfare.<br>
Having seen a Lonely Buddha,<br>
I threw a clod of dirt <span class='add'>at him</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3358'></a> As a result of that karma,<br>
here in <span class='add'>my</span> final existence,<br>
Devadatta hired <span class='add'>some</span> killers<br>
for the sake of murdering me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3359'></a> Once, while I was on <span class='add'>my</span> tusker,<br>
I saw a supreme Lonely Sage,<br>
wandering about for alms food—<br>
with elephant I attacked him. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3360'></a> As a result of that karma,<br>
the elephant Nāḷāgiri,<br>
agitated, cruel, approached me<br>
in the fine town at Vulture’s Peak. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3361'></a> I was the king, <span class='add'>named</span> Patthiva;<br>
I killed a man with a dagger.<br>
As a result of that karma,<br>
I roasted in hell a long time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3362'></a> Through what remained of that karma,<br>
the skin on my foot got all cracked<br>
and caused me a lot of trouble—<br>
karma sure doesn’t just vanish! <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3363'></a> I <span class='add'>once</span> lived as a fisher-boy,<br>
in a village of fishermen.<br>
Having seen the fish getting killed,<br>
pleasurable thoughts filled my mind. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3364'></a> As a result of that karma,<br>
I suffered a headache <span class='add'>one time</span>;<br>
all of the Śākyans were murdered,<br>
when Viḍuḍabha murdered <span class='add'>them</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3365'></a> I reviled the holy words <span class='add'>and</span><br>
followers of Phussa <span class='add'>Buddha</span>,<br>
“chomp <span class='add'>and</span> eat <span class='add'>inferior</span> grain<br>
you all, and don’t eat <span class='add'>any</span> rice.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3366'></a> As a result of that karma,<br>
I <span class='add'>had to</span> eat grain for three months<br>
when, invited by a brahmin,<br>
I lived in various kingdoms. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3367'></a> In the midst of a wrestling match,<br>
a wrestler’s son, I blocked <span class='add'>the fight</span>;<br>
as a result of that karma,<br>
<span class='add'>one time</span> I suffered a backache. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3368'></a> I was a <span class='add'>practicing</span> doctor<br>
and purged the son of a rich man;<br>
as a result of that karma,<br>
I contracted dysentery. <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3369'></a> One time I, Jotipāla, said<br>
to Kassapa, the Well-Gone-One,<br>
“Whence then this baldy’s Waking Up,<br>
Awakening so hard to reach?” <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3370'></a> As a result of that karma,<br>
I practiced great austerities<br>
in Uruvela, six <span class='add'>long</span> years,<br>
and then achieved Awakening. <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3371-72'></a>“Along that path I did not reach<br>
supreme Awakening,” <span class='add'>I thought</span>,<br>
“along which path then should I search,<br>
hindered by previous karma?<br>
Exhausting good and bad <span class='add'>karma</span><br>
<span class='add'>and</span> avoiding every torment<br>
free of grief, troubles <span class='add'>and</span> outflows,<br>
I shall realize nirvana.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw31-32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3373'></a> Thus did he explain, the Victor,<br>
Endowed with All Superpowers,<br>
in front of the monks’ Assembly,<br>
at the great Lake Anotatta. <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
