<p><a class='jw' id='jw4548'></a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
was the Master of Everything.<br>
<span class='add'>While</span> preaching the Four Noble Truths,<br>
he ferried many folks across. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4549'></a> A matted-haired ascetic then,<br>
I practiced fierce austerities.<br>
Throwing off <span class='add'>my</span> clothes made of bark,<br>
I traveled in the sky back then. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4550'></a> I am not <span class='add'>then</span> able to go<br>
over <span class='add'>him,</span> the Best of Buddhas.<br>
Like a bird that has struck a rock,<br>
I am unable to proceed. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4551'></a> Having walked upon the water,<br>
so I am flying through the sky.<br>
Previously my behavior<br>
never had been interrupted. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4552-4553'></a> “Well now I’ll investigate that.<br>
I might get some small benefit.”<br>
Descending from the sky I then<br>
heard the <span class='add'>sweet</span> sound of the Teacher,<br>
who was preaching impermanence<br>
with a voice that was enticing,<br>
good to listen to, beautiful.<br>
I took up that <span class='add'>Teaching</span> back then. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5-6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4554'></a> Having perceived impermanence,<br>
I went <span class='add'>back</span> to my hermitage.<br>
Remaining as long as I lived,<br>
I <span class='add'>later</span> passed away <span class='add'>right</span> there. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4555'></a> In subsequent existences,<br>
I recalled hearing the Teaching.<br>
Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4556'></a> For thirty thousand aeons I<br>
delighted in the world of gods,<br>
and fifty-one times <span class='add'>while there</span>, I<br>
exercised rule over the gods. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4557'></a> And twenty-one times I was <span class='add'>then</span><br>
a king who turns the wheel <span class='add'>of law</span>.<br>
<span class='add'>And I enjoyed</span> much local rule,<br>
innumerable by counting. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4558'></a> I enjoyed <span class='add'>my</span> own good karma,<br>
being happy from birth to birth.<br>
Recalling that perception, I<br>
transmigrated from birth to birth.<br>
I do not comprehend the end,<br>
nirvana, the eternal state. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4559'></a> Sitting down in my father’s house,<br>
a monk with senses <span class='add'>well-</span>controlled<br>
was <span class='add'>then</span> explaining this sermon,<br>
spoken about impermanence: <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4560'></a> “In flux indeed is all that is;<br>
things that arise and <span class='add'>then</span> decline<br>
are being born <span class='add'>and then</span> dying;<br>
happy is the relief from them.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4561'></a> Right after having heard <span class='add'>that</span> verse,<br>
I recalled my past perception.<br>
Sitting down on a single seat,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4562'></a> When <span class='add'>only</span> seven years of age,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship.<br>
The Buddha <span class='add'>himself</span> ordained me:<br>
the fruit of hearing the Teaching. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4563'></a> In the hundred thousand aeons<br>
since I heard the Teaching back then,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
the fruit of hearing the Teaching. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4564'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4565'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4566'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
