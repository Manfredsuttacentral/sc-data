<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5911'></a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
the Sage, Knower of Every World,<br>
the One who had <span class='add'>Five</span> Eyes, arose<br>
a hundred thousand aeons hence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5912'></a>The Admonisher, Instructor,<br>
Crosser-Over of all that breathe,<br>
Skilled at Preaching, <span class='add'>he</span>, the Buddha,<br>
caused many folks to cross <span class='add'>the flood</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5913'></a> Merciful, Compassionate One,<br>
Well-Wisher of all that breathe, he<br>
established in the five precepts<br>
all the rivals who had arrived. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5914'></a> In this way he was Unconfused<br>
and Very Well-Known by rivals,<br>
Ornamented by arahants<br>
who were masters <span class='add'>and</span> neutral ones. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5915'></a> The <span class='add'>body of the</span> Sage So Great<br>
rose up fifty-eight cubits <span class='add'>tall</span>;<br>
he was Valuable Like Gold,<br>
Bearing the Thirty-Two Great Marks. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5916'></a> <span class='add'>People’s</span> lifespan at that time was<br>
<span class='add'>fully</span> one hundred thousand years.<br>
Remaining <span class='add'>in the world</span> so long,<br>
he ferried many folks across. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5917'></a> I then <span class='add'>lived</span> in Haṃsavatī,<br>
A brahmin held in high regard.<br>
Approaching the Torch for the World,<br>
I heard the preaching of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5918'></a> <span class='add'>One</span> of the Great Man’s followers<br>
had an extensive retinue.<br>
I was thrilled after hearing <span class='add'>him</span><br>
being placed in that foremost place. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5919'></a> Inviting <span class='add'>him</span>, the Great Victor,<br>
I gave an almsgiving <span class='add'>to him</span>,<br>
along with <span class='add'>my</span> large entourage,<br>
including a thousand brahmins. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5920'></a> Giving a massive almsgiving,<br>
having saluted the Leader,<br>
happy, standing off at one side,<br>
I spoke these words <span class='add'>to him just then</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5921'></a> “Hero, due to my faith in you<br>
and by virtue of serving <span class='add'>you</span>,<br>
let <span class='add'>me</span> have a large retinue<br>
<span class='add'>while</span> transmigrating here and there.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5922-5923'></a> <span class='add'>Buddha</span>, the Cuckoo-Voiced Teacher,<br>
Elephant-Trumpet-Sounding One,<br>
spoke to the retinue <span class='add'>just</span> then:<br>
“All of you look at this brahmin,<br>
with big arms, the color of gold,<br>
<span class='add'>with</span> face and eyes <span class='add'>like</span> lotuses,<br>
<span class='add'>his</span> body hair growing upward,<br>
happy, with faith in my virtue. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12-13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5924'></a> This one’s aspiring to the place<br>
of the monk with a lion’s roar.<br>
Very far into the future,<br>
he’ll receive that delightful <span class='add'>place</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5925'></a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5926'></a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
the one whose name is Kassapa<br>
will be the Teacher’s follower.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5927'></a> <span class='add'>Then</span> ninety-two aeons ago,<br>
there was a Teacher, Unsurpassed,<br>
Beyond Compare, Unrivaled One:<br>
Phussa, Chief Leader of the World. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5928'></a> That one, having slain all darkness,<br>
untangling the great tangle,<br>
rained forth the rain of deathlessness,<br>
refreshing the <span class='add'>world</span> with <span class='add'>its</span> gods. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5929'></a> In <span class='add'>the city of</span> Benares,<br>
<span class='add'>reborn</span> the king’s sons at that time,<br>
we were three brothers, all of us,<br>
in the confidence of the king. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5930'></a> Strong, with heroic limbs <span class='add'>and</span> looks,<br>
<span class='add'>we’re</span> undefeated in battle.<br>
Then troubled in the borderlands,<br>
the lord of the earth said to us: <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5931'></a> “Come, going to the borderlands,<br>
cleaning up that forest army,<br>
having pacified my kingdom,<br>
come back again,” <span class='add'>is what</span> he said. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5932'></a> Afterward we said <span class='add'>to the king</span>:<br>
“If you’ll give <span class='add'>leave</span> to us to serve<br>
the <span class='add'>Buddha</span>, Leader <span class='add'>of the World</span>,<br>
then we’ll clean up your <span class='add'>enemies</span>.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5933'></a> Then we, having obtained our wish,<br>
sent out by the earth’s protector,<br>
making the borderlands weapon-<br>
free, we came up to him again. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5934'></a> Having asked the king <span class='add'>to let us</span><br>
serve the Teacher, the World-Leader,<br>
getting the Excellent Sage, we<br>
worshipped him as long as <span class='add'>we</span> lived. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5935-5937'></a> Giving very expensive cloth,<br>
and abundant tasty <span class='add'>alms food</span>,<br>
and lodgings <span class='add'>which were</span> delightful,<br>
and beneficial medicines<br>
to the Sage with the monks, neutral<br>
toward birth because of the Teaching,<br>
We, moral <span class='add'>and</span> compassionate,<br>
minds engaged in meditation,<br>
with loving hearts, having waited<br>
on the <span class='add'>World-</span>Leader all the time,<br>
when the World-Chief reached nirvana,<br>
worshipping with all of <span class='add'>our</span> strength, <a class='vjw' id='vjw25-27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5938'></a> fallen from there, gone to heaven,<br>
all <span class='add'>three</span> of us experienced<br>
great happiness <span class='add'>when</span> in that place:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5939'></a> Like an illusionist on stage<br>
showing <span class='add'>himself as</span> very large,<br>
thus touring in existence I<br>
became the king of Videha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5940-5942'></a> At the word of naked Guṇa,<br>
become dependent on wrong views,<br>
I got onto an evil path.<br>
Not heeding the advice <span class='add'>given</span><br>
by my daughter <span class='add'>known as</span> Rujā,<br>
I <span class='add'>later</span> being much-advised<br>
by the brahmin <span class='add'>named</span> Nārada,<br>
giving up <span class='add'>Guṇa’s</span> evil views,<br>
having fulfilled with distinction<br>
the ten <span class='add'>wholesome</span> ways of acting,<br>
abandoning <span class='add'>my</span> body, I<br>
went to heaven with a palace. <a class='vjw' id='vjw30-32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5943'></a> When <span class='add'>my</span> last rebirth was attained,<br>
I was a kinsman of Brahmā,<br>
born in Benares with great wealth,<br>
in a large brahmin family. <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5944'></a> Fearing death, illness <span class='add'>and</span> old age,<br>
and abandoning <span class='add'>my</span> great wealth,<br>
seeking the path to nirvana,<br>
I went forth as a Jaṭila. <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5945'></a> <span class='add'>And</span> then those two brothers of mine<br>
<span class='add'>also</span> went forth along with me.<br>
Having built in Uruvelā<br>
a hermitage, I <span class='add'>then</span> lived there. <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5946'></a> Named “Kassapa” through <span class='add'>my</span> lineage,<br>
since I dwelt in Uruvelā,<br>
I was therefore known <span class='add'>by the name</span><br>
of “Uruvela Kassapa.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5947'></a> My brother <span class='add'>lived</span> near the river;<br>
he was named “Nadī Kassapa.”<br>
<span class='add'>The other lived</span> close to Gāyā;<br>
by name he’s “Gāyā Kassapa”. <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5948'></a> Two hundred for Nadīkassapa,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> three for the middle brother.<br>
No less than five hundred for me,<br>
students who all <span class='add'>then</span> followed me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw38'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5949'></a> Then the Buddha, approaching me,<br>
the World-Chief, Charioteer of Men,<br>
doing various miracles,<br>
he led me <span class='add'>on the correct path</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw39'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5950'></a> I was <span class='add'>ordained</span>, “come monk,” along<br>
with a lakh <span class='add'>in my</span> retinue;<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship,<br>
together with all of them <span class='add'>too</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw40'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5951'></a> They and also many others<br>
were students attending on me.<br>
I was able to instruct <span class='add'>them,</span><br>
as the Seventh Sage <span class='add'>advised</span> me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw41'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5952'></a> He placed me in the foremost place<br>
<span class='add'>of those with a</span> large retinue.<br>
O! the deed done for the Buddha<br>
<span class='add'>certainly</span> bore <span class='add'>its</span> fruit for me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw42'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5953'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw43'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5954'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw44'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5955'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw45'></a></p>
