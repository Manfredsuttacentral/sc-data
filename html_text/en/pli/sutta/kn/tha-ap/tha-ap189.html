<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2185'></a> When according to <span class='add'>his</span> lifespan,<br>
a god falls from the world,<br>
three sayings get emitted <span class='add'>then,</span><br>
<span class='add'>in</span> the rejoicing of the gods. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2186'></a> “From here, sir, go to a good state,<br>
in the company of people.<br>
Becoming human do obtain<br>
great faith in the Excellent Truth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2187'></a> “Having established that, your faith,<br>
in the well-known Excellent Truth,<br>
<span class='add'>well-</span>fixed, born of <span class='add'>those happy</span> roots,<br>
<span class='add'>be</span> steadfast as long as <span class='add'>you</span> live. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2188'></a> “Doing good <span class='add'>deeds</span> with <span class='add'>your</span> body,<br>
<span class='add'>and doing</span> much good with <span class='add'>your</span> speech;<br>
doing good with <span class='add'>your</span> mind <span class='add'>as well,</span><br>
<span class='add'>be</span> free of hate and attachment. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2189'></a> “Thus exalting the life <span class='add'>you live</span>,<br>
doing merit with much giving,<br>
make other men also enter<br>
the chaste life <span class='add'>and</span> Excellent Truth.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2190'></a> When gods know that a god’s falling,<br>
<span class='add'>filled</span> with this <span class='add'>sort of</span> compassion,<br>
they rejoice <span class='add'>about his rebirth</span>:<br>
“O god come <span class='add'>back</span> repeatedly.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2191'></a> I was moved when at that time the<br>
assembly of gods had gathered,<br>
“Well now then to what womb should I<br>
go when <span class='add'>I have</span> fallen from here?” <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2192-2193'></a>Padumuttara’s follower,<br>
known by the name of Sumana,<br>
a monk with senses <span class='add'>well-</span>controlled,<br>
realizing that I was moved<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> desiring to lift me up,<br>
did come into my presence then<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> stirred me up instructing <span class='add'>me</span><br>
in the meaning and the Teaching. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8-9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2194'></a> Having listened to his words, I<br>
made my heart pleased in the Buddha.<br>
Having saluted that wise <span class='add'>monk,</span><br>
I <span class='add'>then</span> passed away on the spot. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2195'></a> I was reborn right then and there,<br>
incited by <span class='add'>those</span> happy roots.<br>
For one hundred thousand aeons<br>
I was not born in a bad state. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2196'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
