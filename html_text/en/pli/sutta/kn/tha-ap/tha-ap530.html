<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5585'></a> Formerly I took Bodhi leaves,<br>
fallen in the stupa-courtyard,<br>
and <span class='add'>having swept,</span> threw <span class='add'>them</span> away.<br>
I <span class='add'>then</span> obtained twenty virtues: <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5586'></a> Through the power of that karma,<br>
transmigrating from birth to birth,<br>
I transmigrate in <span class='add'>just</span> two states:<br>
that of a god, or of a man. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5587'></a> Falling from the world of the gods,<br>
having come to the human state,<br>
I’m being born in <span class='add'>just</span> two clans:<br>
the kṣatriyan and the brahmin. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5588'></a> I possess perfected limbs, \[with<br>
proper\] length and circumference;<br>
I’m very handsome <span class='add'>and</span> splendid,<br>
<span class='add'>with</span> complete limbs, no<span class='add'>thing</span> lacking. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5589'></a> In the world of gods or of men,<br>
in whichever place I‘m reborn,<br>
I am golden-colored for life,<br>
to be compared with molten gold. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5590'></a> Due to well-thrown-out Bodhi leaves,<br>
all of the time my outer skin<br>
is pliable <span class='add'>and</span> soft <span class='add'>and</span> smooth,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> fine like a very young boy’s. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5591'></a> When my body has arisen<br>
in whatever state of rebirth,<br>
I am not soiled with dirt and dust:<br>
the result of thrown-away leaves. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5592'></a> When there is heat or burning wind,<br>
<span class='add'>or</span> through the heat of fire on it,<br>
on my body no sweat’s released:<br>
the result of thrown-away leaves. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5593'></a> On <span class='add'>my</span> body there’s no ringworm,<br>
rashes, abscesses, leprosy,<br>
and likewise <span class='add'>neither</span> moles <span class='add'>nor</span> boils:<br>
the result of thrown-away leaves. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5594'></a> And it has another virtue,<br>
being reborn life after life;<br>
in <span class='add'>my</span> body there’s no disease:<br>
the result of thrown-away leaves. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5595'></a> And it has another virtue,<br>
being reborn life after life;<br>
there’s no torment born of the mind:<br>
the result of thrown-away leaves. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5596'></a> And it has another virtue,<br>
being reborn life after life;<br>
for it there are no enemies:<br>
the result of thrown-away leaves. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5597'></a> And it has another virtue,<br>
being reborn life after life;<br>
there is no lack of possessions:<br>
the result of thrown-away leaves. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5598'></a> And it has another virtue,<br>
being reborn life after life;<br>
there is no fear in the water,<br>
nor from fire, from kings, <span class='add'>and</span> from thieves. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5599'></a> And it has another virtue,<br>
being reborn life after life;<br>
slaves <span class='add'>and</span> slave-girls are serving <span class='add'>me,</span><br>
in accordance with <span class='add'>their own</span> hearts. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5600'></a> When he’s born in a human state,<br>
with whatever measure lifespan,<br>
that lifespan does not then decline,<br>
it lasts the lifespan’s full extent. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5601'></a> Moving about inside and out,<br>
those from <span class='add'>my</span> city and country,<br>
are all engaged all of the time,<br>
wishing to grow and be happy. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5602'></a> I’m wealthy, famous, splendorous;<br>
on the side of my relatives.<br>
Free of trembling and fear of ghosts,<br>
from every life <span class='add'>to each new</span> life. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5603'></a> Gods <span class='add'>and</span> men <span class='add'>and</span> titans <span class='add'>as well</span>,<br>
music-nymphs, spirits <span class='add'>and</span> demons;<br>
they are protecting <span class='add'>me</span> always,<br>
transmigrating in existence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5604'></a> Having enjoyed both <span class='add'>kinds of</span> fame,<br>
in the world of gods and of men,<br>
at the end I have <span class='add'>now</span> attained<br>
peaceful, unsurpassed nirvana. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5605'></a> For a rich man making merit,<br>
specifying the Sambuddha,<br>
or the Bodhi of the Teacher,<br>
what is there that’s hard to obtain?</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5606'></a> Being better than the others<br>
in path-fruit in the religion,<br>
in trance, special knowledge, virtue;<br>
I reach nirvana, undefiled. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5607'></a> Formerly, with a happy mind,<br>
I threw away <span class='add'>those</span> Bodhi leaves;<br>
endowed with these twenty <span class='add'>virtues</span><br>
I am existing all the time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5608'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5609'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5610'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
