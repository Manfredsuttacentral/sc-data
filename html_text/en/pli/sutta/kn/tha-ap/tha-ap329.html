<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2863'></a> When according to <span class='add'>his</span> lifespan,<br>
a god falls from the world,<br>
three sayings get emitted <span class='add'>then,</span><br>
<span class='add'>in</span> the rejoicing of the gods. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2864'></a>“From here, sir, go to a good state,<br>
in the company of people.<br>
Becoming human do obtain<br>
great faith in the Excellent Truth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2865'></a> Having established that, your faith,<br>
in the well-known Excellent Truth,<br>
<span class='add'>well-</span>fixed, born of <span class='add'>those happy</span> roots,<br>
<span class='add'>be</span> steadfast as long as <span class='add'>you</span> live. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2866'></a> Doing good deeds with <span class='add'>your</span> body,<br>
<span class='add'>and doing</span> much good with <span class='add'>your</span> speech;<br>
doing good with <span class='add'>your</span> mind <span class='add'>as well,</span><br>
<span class='add'>be</span> free of hate and attachment. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2867'></a> Thus exalting the life <span class='add'>you live</span>,<br>
doing merit with much giving,<br>
make other men also enter<br>
the chaste life <span class='add'>and</span> Excellent Truth.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2868'></a> When gods know that a god’s falling,<br>
<span class='add'>filled</span> with this <span class='add'>sort of</span> compassion,<br>
they rejoice <span class='add'>about his rebirth</span>:<br>
“O god come <span class='add'>back</span> repeatedly.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2869'></a> I was moved when at that time the<br>
assembly of gods had gathered,<br>
“Well now then to what womb should I<br>
go when <span class='add'>I have</span> fallen from here?” <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2870-2871'></a>Padumuttara’s follower,<br>
known by the name of Sumana,<br>
a monk with senses <span class='add'>well-</span>controlled,<br>
realizing that I was moved<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> desiring to lift me up,<br>
did come into my presence then<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> stirred me up instructing <span class='add'>me</span><br>
in the meaning and the Teaching. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8-9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2872'></a>The Twelfth Recitation Portion<br>
Having listened to his words I<br>
made <span class='add'>my</span> heart pleased in the Buddha.<br>
Having saluted that hero<br>
I <span class='add'>then</span> passed away on the spot. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2873'></a> I was reborn right then and there,<br>
incited by <span class='add'>those</span> happy roots.<br>
Even dwelling in mother’s womb,<br>
I was my mother’s instructor. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2874'></a> Having fallen from that body<br>
I was reborn in Thirty-Three.<br>
Within that <span class='add'>heaven</span>, then, for me,<br>
mental disturbance was not seen. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2875'></a> Fallen from Tāvatiŋsa <span class='add'>too,</span><br>
I came in to a mother’s womb.<br>
Coming out from <span class='add'>that</span> womb I knew<br>
<span class='add'>the diff’rence between</span> black and white. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2876'></a> Being <span class='add'>only</span> seven years old,<br>
I entered the park-hermitage<br>
of Gotama, the Blessed One,<br>
the Śākyan Son, the Neutral One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2877'></a> When the dispensation had spread<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> the Teaching was popular,<br>
I saw the Teacher’s <span class='add'>own</span> monks there,<br>
doers of his dispensation. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2878'></a> The city there, named Śrāvasti<br>
had a king known as Kosala.<br>
By elephant-chariot he<br>
came to the supreme Bodhi <span class='add'>tree</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2879'></a> Having seen his elephant <span class='add'>there</span>,<br>
recalling <span class='add'>my own</span> past karma,<br>
pressing both my hands together,<br>
I <span class='add'>also</span> went to the event. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2880-2881'></a>Being <span class='add'>only</span> seven years old,<br>
I went forth into homelessness.<br>
He who looked after the Buddha<br>
was the follower Ānanda,<br>
perfectly behaved, resolute,<br>
mindful and very learned too.<br>
He took charge of the Brilliant One,<br>
bringing pleasure to the king’s heart. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18-19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2882'></a> After having heard his Teaching,<br>
I recalled <span class='add'>my own</span> past karma.<br>
Standing in that very <span class='add'>spot</span> I<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2883'></a> Putting a robe on one shoulder.<br>
hands pressed together on <span class='add'>my</span> head,<br>
saluting <span class='add'>him</span>, the Sambuddha,<br>
I uttered this speech <span class='add'>then and there</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2884'></a> “Gathering <i lang='pli' translate='no'>nigguṇḍi</i> blossoms<br>
I placed them on the lion-throne<br>
of Padumuttara Buddha,<br>
the Lord of Bipeds, the Teacher. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2285'></a> Through that deed, O Biped Lord,<br>
O World’s Best, O Bull among Men,<br>
I’ve achieved the un-shaking state<br>
without victory or defeat. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2886'></a> In aeon twenty-five-thousand,<br>
royal lords of men numbered in<br>
crore-hundred-trillions and hundred-<br>
trillion-hundred-trillions, eight each. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2887'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>

<p>Thus indeed Venerable Nigguṇḍipupphiya Thera spoke these verses.</p>
