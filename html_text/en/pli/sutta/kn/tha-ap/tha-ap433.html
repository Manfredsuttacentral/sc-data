<p><a class='jw' id='jw4630'></a> In this <span class='add'>present</span> lucky aeon<br>
Brahmā’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,<br>
named Kassapa through <span class='add'>his</span> lineage,<br>
Best Debater, <span class='add'>Buddha</span> arose. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4631'></a> Non-Delayed One, Unsupported,<br>
Whose Mind is as Level as Space,<br>
Very Empty, Neutral, Not Fond<br>
of Appearances, the Master, <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4632'></a> Heart Unattached, Defilement-Free,<br>
Not Mixing in the clan <span class='add'>and</span> group,<br>
Greatly Compassionate, Hero,<br>
Skilled in means of disciplining, <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4633-4634'></a> Active in duties to others,<br>
Training <span class='add'>the whole world</span> with <span class='add'>its</span> gods,<br>
Drying Up the muddiness on<br>
road that leads to nirvana—<br>
undying, supreme enjoyment,<br>
obstacle to old age and death—<br>
the One Who Helps the World Across<br>
was seated amidst a huge crowd. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4-5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4635'></a> Lord, with the Voice of a Cuckoo,<br>
the Sound of Brahmā, Thus-Gone-One,<br>
Lifting <span class='add'>those on</span> very bad roads<br>
who are lost without a Leader, <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4636'></a> preaching the stainless Teaching <span class='add'>then,</span><br>
the World-Leader was seen by me.<br>
Having listened to his Teaching,<br>
I went forth into homelessness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4637'></a> Going forth, I was then thinking<br>
of the Victor’s dispensation;<br>
weighed down by associations,<br>
I lived alone in lovely woods. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4638'></a> Physical solitude became<br>
the great condition <span class='add'>then</span> for me,<br>
possessed of mental solitude,<br>
looking at meetings fearfully. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4639'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4640'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4641'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>

<p>Thus indeed Venerable Ekavihāriya Thera spoke these verses.</p>
