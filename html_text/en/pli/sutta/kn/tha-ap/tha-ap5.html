<p><a class='jw' id='jw399'></a><a class='jw' id='jw400a-b'></a> When the World-Chief had passed away<br>
the people, with exalted minds,<br>
intoxicated with delight<br>
did <i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i> for the Neutral One,<br>
the Teacher, who was the World’s Best,<br>
Blessed One, Padumuttara. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw400c-d'></a><a class='jw' id='jw401'></a> When their religious emotion<br>
was born, great joy arose in me.<br>
Gathering my family and friends<br>
I spoke these words <span class='add'>to all of them</span>:<br>
“the Great Hero has passed away;<br>
surely we should do a <i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>!” <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw402'></a> They agreed saying, “Excellent!”<br>
which made me smile even more.<br>
“We’ll make a meritorious pyre<br>
over the Buddha, the World-Chief.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw403'></a> We made a well-made festoon work<br>
which was one hundred hands in height,<br>
and we raised up into the sky<br>
a mansion fifty hands higher. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw404'></a> Having made that festoon work there,<br>
decorated with rows of stripes,<br>
bringing pleasure to <span class='add'>my</span> own mind<br>
I worshipped that excellent shrine. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw405'></a> Like a blazing column of fire,<br>
like a regal <i lang='pli' translate='no'>sal</i> tree in bloom,<br>
like Indra’s post up in the sky<br>
it shined in the four directions. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw406'></a> After making <span class='add'>my</span> mind pleased there<br>
and doing much that was wholesome,<br>
recalling karma from the past<br>
I was born with the thirty <span class='add'>gods</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw407'></a> I possessed a divine chariot<br>
yoked with one thousand <span class='add'>fine</span> horses.<br>
That tall residence of mine <span class='add'>there</span><br>
was seven stories <span class='add'>tall</span> in height. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw408'></a> It had one thousand gabled cells;<br>
all <span class='add'>of them were</span> made out of gold.<br>
It blazed by means of its own power<br>
lighting up every direction. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw409'></a> There were also other doorways<br>
<span class='add'>all</span> made of rubies <span class='add'>at that time</span>.<br>
With their light they too illumined<br>
the four directions entirely. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw410'></a> Those well-constructed gabled cells<br>
produced by <span class='add'>my past</span> good karma<br>
and <span class='add'>all</span> the gemstone <span class='add'>doors</span> then shined<br>
in ten directions on all sides. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw411'></a> When they were thus <span class='add'>all</span> shining forth<br>
there was a massive effulgence.<br>
I surpassed all the <span class='add'>other</span> gods;<br>
that is the fruit of good karma. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw412'></a> Sixty thousand aeons ago<br>
I was the king named Ubbiddha.<br>
Victorious on <span class='add'>all</span> four sides<br>
I took the earth as residence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw413'></a> In that most auspicious aeon<br>
for fully thirty times I was<br>
a wheel-turning king with great strength<br>
deriving from my own karma. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw413-414'></a> Possessor of the seven jewels<br>
I‘m lord of the four continents.<br>
And in that place my residence<br>
was as tall as the tree of Indra. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw414-415'></a> It was twenty-four <span class='add'>leagues</span> in length,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> in width <span class='add'>it measured</span> twelve <span class='add'>leagues</span>.<br>
<span class='add'>My</span> city was named Rammaka;<br>
it had strong ramparts and gateways. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw415'></a> It was five hundred <span class='add'>leagues</span> in length,<br>
in width two hundred fifty <span class='add'>leagues</span>.<br>
It was crowded with groups of men<br>
just like the thirty-three gods’ city. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw416'></a> Like needles in a needle-case<br>
there were twenty <span class='add'>different</span> bazaars<br>
<span class='add'>where</span> they gather, one another;<br>
<span class='add'>the city</span> was <span class='add'>very</span> crowded. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw417'></a> Of such a sort was my city,<br>
with elephants, horses, chariots<br>
and <span class='add'>very</span> crowded with people:<br>
Rammaka, excellent city. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw418'></a> Having lived there and having left<br>
I returned to the world of gods.<br>
In this, my final existence,<br>
I’m born in an accomplished clan. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw419'></a> Born into a brahmin family<br>
I had a massive heap of gems.<br>
Eight hundred million <span class='add'>worth of</span> gold<br>
abandoned, I went forth renouncing. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw420'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw421'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught!</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw422'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
