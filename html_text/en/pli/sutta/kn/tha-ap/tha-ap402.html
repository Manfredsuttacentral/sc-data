<p><a class='jw' id='jw3856'></a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
was the Master of Everything.<br>
Plunged into the Himalayas,<br>
the Leader of the World sat down. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3857'></a> I did not see the Sambuddha,<br>
I also did not hear <span class='add'>his</span> sound.<br>
Searching for food for me to eat,<br>
I was wandering in the woods. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3858'></a> There I did see the Sambuddha,<br>
Bearing the Thirty-two Great Marks.<br>
Seeing <span class='add'>the Buddha</span> made me think,<br>
“what sort of being might this be?” <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3859'></a> Examining <span class='add'>his body’s</span> marks,<br>
I recalled my <span class='add'>studies of</span> lore,<br>
the good words which I <span class='add'>once</span> had heard,<br>
from elderly men of wisdom: <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3860'></a> “According to that word of theirs,<br>
this <span class='add'>person</span> will be a Buddha;<br>
well then I ought to honor <span class='add'>him</span>;<br>
it will purify my station.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3861'></a> Quickly coming to <span class='add'>my</span> ashram,<br>
I grabbed <span class='add'>some</span> buffalo ghee, and<br>
taking a pot <span class='add'>to carry it,</span><br>
I approached <span class='add'>him</span>, the Bull of Men. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3862'></a> Taking a three-legged <span class='add'>stool</span>, I<br>
stood it <span class='add'>up</span> in an open space.<br>
Lighting a lamp <span class='add'>placed on that stool,</span><br>
I worshipped <span class='add'>the Buddha</span> eight times. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3863'></a> Seven nights and days the Buddha,<br>
sat <span class='add'>there</span>, the Ultimate Person.<br>
Then at the end of the <span class='add'>last</span> night,<br>
<span class='add'>Buddha</span> stood up, the World-Leader.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3864'></a> Happy, with pleasure in <span class='add'>my</span> heart,<br>
for seven nights and days I lit<br>
<span class='add'>that</span> lamp for the <span class='add'>seated</span> Buddha,<br>
<span class='add'>feeling well-</span>pleased by my own hands.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3865'></a> All the good scents of the forests<br>
on Gandhamādana Mountain,<br>
by means of Buddha’s majesty<br>
then went up to <span class='add'>him</span>, the Victor.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3866'></a> <span class='add'>All of</span> the trees <span class='add'>were then</span> in bloom.<br>
By means of Buddha’s majesty<br>
all of the floral scents produced,<br>
assembled into one right then.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3867'></a> Throughout the Himalayas, both<br>
the snake-gods and the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>garuḷas</i>,<br>
desiring to hear the Teaching,<br>
came into the Buddha’s presence.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3868'></a> The monk whose name was Devala<br>
was the Buddha’s chief attendant.<br>
With one hundred thousand masters,<br>
he <span class='add'>also</span> approached the Buddha.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3869'></a> Padumuttara, World-Knower,<br>
Sacrificial Recipient,<br>
seated in the monks’ Assembly,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> spoke these verses <span class='add'>about me</span>:</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3870'></a> “He who has lit a lamp for me,<br>
<span class='add'>feeling well-</span>pleased by his own hands,<br>
I shall relate details of him;<br>
<span class='add'>all of</span> you listen to my words:</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3871'></a> For sixty thousand aeons he<br>
will delight in the world of gods.<br>
A thousand times he’ll be a king,<br>
a king who turns the wheel <span class='add'>of law</span>.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3872'></a> Thirty-six times lord of the gods,<br>
he will exercise divine rule.<br>
Seven hundred <span class='add'>times</span> on the earth,<br>
he’ll rule an extensive kingdom,<br>
<span class='add'>and he will have</span> much local rule,<br>
innumerable by counting.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3873'></a> Because of this lamp-offering,<br>
he will develop “divine eye.”<br>
This one is always going to see<br>
eight <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kosas</i> in all directions.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3874'></a> Fallen from the world of the gods,<br>
when this person has been reborn,<br>
whether by day or else by night,<br>
a lamp will be carried <span class='add'>for him</span>.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3875'></a> When this person’s being reborn,<br>
a possessor of good karma,<br>
he will illuminate <span class='add'>the world</span><br>
throughout the city <span class='add'>where</span> he is.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3876'></a>In whichever womb he’s reborn,<br>
<span class='add'>whether</span> it’s human or divine,<br>
because of his lamp-offering,<br>
due to the fruit of <span class='add'>those</span> eight lamps,<br>
people will not surpass this one:<br>
that is the fruit of giving lamps.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3877'></a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3878'></a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
knowing well all the defilements,<br>
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3879'></a> Having pleased <span class='add'>him</span>, the Sambuddha,<br>
Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,<br>
he’ll be the Teacher’s follower,<br>
<span class='add'>and his</span> name <span class='add'>will be</span> Ajita.”</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3880'></a> For sixty thousand aeons I<br>
delighted in the world of gods.<br>
In that place too my hundred lamps<br>
are burning <span class='add'>brightly</span> all the time.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3881'></a> In the gods’ world or that of men,<br>
my <span class='add'>own</span> effulgence is diffused.<br>
Remembering the Best Buddha,<br>
I generate enormous mirth.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3882'></a> Falling from Tusitā heaven,<br>
I came out of a mother’s womb.<br>
While that person was being born,<br>
there was <span class='add'>always</span> a lot of light.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3883'></a> Having departed from the house,<br>
I went forth into homelessness.<br>
Having gone up to Bāvarī,<br>
I agreed to be his student.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3884'></a> Living in the Himalayas,<br>
I heard <span class='add'>about</span> the World-Leader.<br>
Searching for ultimate meaning,<br>
I approached <span class='add'>the Buddha</span>, the Guide.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3885'></a> The Tame One, Buddha, He who Tames,<br>
the Flood-Crosser, Beyond Rebirth,<br>
the Buddha spoke of nirvana,<br>
liberation from all dis-ease.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3886'></a> His coming to me succeeded;<br>
I entertained <span class='add'>him</span>, the Great Sage.<br>
Attaining the three knowledges,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught!</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3887'></a> In the hundred thousand aeons<br>
since I gave <span class='add'>him</span> that lamp back then,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of giving lamps.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3888'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
All defilements are exhausted;<br>
now there will be no more rebirth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3889'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3890'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
