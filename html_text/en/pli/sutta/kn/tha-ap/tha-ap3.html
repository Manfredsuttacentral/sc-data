<p>Now listen to the legends of the Theras:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw140'></a> Close to the Himalayan range,<br>
<span class='add'>on</span> the mountain called Lambaka,<br>
my ashram is very well made,<br>
a well-constructed hall of leaves. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw141'></a> There’s a river, with gentle banks,<br>
well-fixed, delightful to the mind,<br>
and strewn about with bright white sand,<br>
not very far from my ashram. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw142'></a> Free of gravel <span class='add'>and</span> free of slopes,<br>
excellent, without bad odors,<br>

are abundant in my ashram. <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw170'></a> That well-created tank is there<br>
not very far from the ashram,<br>
with clear water, cool for drinking,<br>
well-fixed, delightful to the mind. <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw171'></a> Covered with pink and blue lotus,<br>
combined with white lotus flowers<br>
and covered again with <i lang='pli' translate='no'>mandālaka</i><br>
it exudes a heavenly scent. <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw172'></a> At that time I was then living<br>
in that well-made, lovely ashram<br>
in the woods blooming and fruiting<br>
and thus endowed with everything. <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw173'></a> I was ascetic Saruci<br>
of noble-conduct, vow-taker,<br>
a meditator, trance-lover,<br>
strong in the five special knowledges. <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw174'></a> Four and twenty thousand students<br>
were waiting upon me back then.<br>
They all were from the Brahmin caste,<br>
of noble birth and glorious. <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw175'></a> They’d reached perfection in my teachings<br>
of grammar and vocabulary,<br>
of synonyms and metrics too,<br>
and reading signs, and history. <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw176'></a> They were skilled as interpreters<br>
of events and omens and signs<br>
on the earth and ground, in the sky;<br>
my students were very well-trained. <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw177'></a> Satisfied they were, and prudent;<br>
ate little food, had no desires.<br>
Happy if receiving or not,<br>
they always gathered around me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw38'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw178'></a> Meditators, trance-lovers,<br>
wise, attentive, with peaceful minds,<br>
with wishes for <span class='add'>only</span> nothing,<br>
they always gathered around me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw39'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw179'></a> Masters of special knowledges,<br>
delighting in their brahmin ways,<br>
able to fly through the sky, most wise,<br>
they always gathered around me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw40'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw180'></a> They kept the six sense-doors well-closed,<br>
were lust-free, with guarded sense-organs,<br>
<span class='add'>most</span> wise, and not tied down at home:<br>
no one came close to my students. <a class='vjw' id='vjw41'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw181'></a> At night they always passed the time<br>
<span class='add'>meditating</span> seated cross-legged<br>
or walking back and forth in place;<br>
no one came close to my students. <a class='vjw' id='vjw42'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw182'></a> Not aroused in what’s arousing,<br>
nor defiled in what’s defiling;<br>
not fooling self in foolish things:<br>
no one came close to my students. <a class='vjw' id='vjw43'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw183'></a> They spent all <span class='add'>their</span> time studying<br>
<span class='add'>all</span> the miraculous powers.<br>
They could set the earth to quaking<br>
with haughtiness none could approach. <a class='vjw' id='vjw44'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw184'></a> When those students were playing sports<br>
they sported in the altered states,<br>
brought rose-apples from <span class='add'>distant</span> trees;<br>
no one came close to my students. <a class='vjw' id='vjw45'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw185'></a> Some would travel to Goyāna,<br>
others to Pubbavideha,<br>
and some to Utturukuru:<br>
no one came close to my students. <a class='vjw' id='vjw46'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw186'></a> They’d send their requisites ahead<br>
and then they’d proceed after <span class='add'>them</span>;<br>
the sky was totally covered<br>
by twenty-four thousand <span class='add'>students</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw47'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw187'></a> Some ate cooked food and some ate raw,<br>
some ground with teeth, others with mortars.<br>
Some ate food that they ground on stone,<br>
some only fruits that had fallen. <a class='vjw' id='vjw48'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw188'></a> Some <span class='add'>bathed</span> getting into water,<br>
<span class='add'>others</span> loved the pure evening <span class='add'>rain</span><br>
<span class='add'>while others</span> bathed sprinkling water:<br>
no one came close to my students. <a class='vjw' id='vjw49'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw189'></a> With nails and armpit hair grown long,<br>
muck in <span class='add'>their</span> teeth, heads <span class='add'>soiled</span> with dirt<br>
and perfumed <span class='add'>only</span> with precepts:<br>
no one came close to my students. <a class='vjw' id='vjw50'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw190'></a> Those famed matted-haired ascetics<br>
would assemble in the morning,<br>
saying what they’d received, and not,<br>
then set off <span class='add'>flying</span> through the air. <a class='vjw' id='vjw51'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw191'></a> A mighty din would issue forth<br>
from them as they were taking off.<br>
The gods would be most delighted<br>
by that sound of <span class='add'>their</span> deer-hide robes. <a class='vjw' id='vjw52'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw192'></a> Traveling in all directions<br>
those sages, flying through the sky<br>
would go to any place they wished<br>
by means of their own <span class='add'>vast</span> power. <a class='vjw' id='vjw53'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw193'></a> They could set the earth to quaking;<br>
all of them were sky-travelers.<br>
Famed ascetics, hard to conquer,<br>
they were steady like the ocean. <a class='vjw' id='vjw54'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw194'></a> Some walked back and forth meditating<br>
some sages did so while seated,<br>
some of them lived on fallen-fruits;<br>
no one came close to my students. <a class='vjw' id='vjw55'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw195'></a> They dwelt always in states of love<br>
and were kindly to all creatures.<br>
None of them raised his own self up<br>
and they felt hatred toward no one. <a class='vjw' id='vjw56'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw196'></a> Fearless like the king of lions,<br>
mighty like an elephant king,<br>
hard to approach like a tiger<br>
they would come into my presence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw57'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw197'></a> Sorcerers and <span class='add'>their</span> deities,<br>
cobra-gods, music-nymphs, demons,<br>
fairies, titans <span class='add'>and</span> <i lang='pli' translate='no'>garuḷas</i><br>
are living on that lake. <a class='vjw' id='vjw58'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw198'></a> Those dread-locked requisite-bearers<br>
dressed in superb deer-leather <span class='add'>clothes</span>,<br>
all those sages, sky-travelers,<br>
are living on that lake <span class='add'>there then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw59'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw199'></a> As is always appropriate<br>
they respected one another.<br>
From twenty-four thousand students<br>
not the sound of a sneeze is heard. <a class='vjw' id='vjw60'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw200'></a> One foot placed after the other<br>
making little sound, self-controlled,<br>
all of them, after they’d come close<br>
are worshipping me with their heads. <a class='vjw' id='vjw61'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw201'></a> Thus surrounded by those students<br>
peaceful, doing austerities,<br>
I <span class='add'>then</span> dwelt in that ashram there<br>
meditator, trance-lover. <a class='vjw' id='vjw62'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw202'></a> My ashram was always perfumed<br>
by those sages’ morality<br>
and the scents of both blooming flowers<br>
and the different fruits <span class='add'>that grew there</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw63'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw203'></a> By night and day I never know<br>
displeasure, nor does it come to me.<br>
Giving my students instruction,<br>
I am constantly filled with joy. <a class='vjw' id='vjw64'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw204'></a> The blossoming of many flowers<br>
and ripening of many fruits<br>
are exuding heavenly scents<br>
making my ashram beautiful. <a class='vjw' id='vjw65'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw205'></a> Arising from meditation<br>
I’m zealous and intelligent.<br>
Taking ascetics’ requisites<br>
I proceeded into the woods. <a class='vjw' id='vjw66'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw206'></a> I was well-trained to read the signs<br>
surrounding births and portents <span class='add'>too</span>.<br>
At that time I’d <span class='add'>fully</span> mastered<br>
all the mantras in existence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw67'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw207'></a> Anomadassi, Blessed One,<br>
the World’s Best, the Bull Among Men,<br>
the Buddha, seeking solitude<br>
entered the Himalayas <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw68'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw208'></a> Going into Himalaya<br>
the Supreme, Compassionate Sage,<br>
getting into lotus posture<br>
sat down, the Ultimate Person. <a class='vjw' id='vjw69'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw209'></a> <span class='add'>Then</span> I saw that Sambuddha <span class='add'>there</span>,<br>
shining light, a mental delight,<br>
bright like a blue water lily,<br>
blazing up like a fire-altar. <a class='vjw' id='vjw70'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw210'></a> I saw the Leader of the World<br>
like a regal <i lang='pli' translate='no'>sal</i> tree in bloom;<br>
blazing forth like a tree of lamps;<br>
lightening flaring in a cloud-bank. <a class='vjw' id='vjw71'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw211'></a> “This <i lang='pli' translate='no'>nāga</i> is the Great Hero,<br>
the Sage who ended suffering;”<br>
after coming to see this one<br>
all suffering was cast away. <a class='vjw' id='vjw72'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw212'></a> After seeing that God of Gods<br>
adorned with the auspicious marks<br>
I thought, “is he Buddha or not?<br>
Surely I’m seeing One with Eyes.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw73'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw213'></a> One thousand wheel-marks are seen<br>
on his unsurpassed <span class='add'>lovely</span> foot.<br>
I, having seen those marks of his,<br>
concluded he’s the Thus-Gone-One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw74'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw214'></a> I brought in a broom for sweeping<br>
and having done the sweeping then<br>
I gathered eight blooming flowers<br>
for <i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i> to that Best Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw75'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw215'></a> After <i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i> to that Buddha,<br>
the Flood-Crosser, Undefiled One,<br>
placing deer-hide on one shoulder<br>
I worshipped the Chief of the World. <a class='vjw' id='vjw76'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw216'></a> “The knowledge by which the Buddha<br>
dwells without <span class='add'>any</span> defilements—<br>
that knowledge I shall now proclaim;<br>
<span class='add'>all of</span> you listen to my words! <a class='vjw' id='vjw77'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw217'></a> May you lift this world up rightly<br>
Self-Become One, Boundless Increase!<br>
Coming into the sight of you<br>
they cross the rushing stream of doubt. <a class='vjw' id='vjw78'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw218'></a> You’re the Teacher for those who breathe,<br>
the Banner, the Flag and the Pole;<br>
you are the Goal, the Solid Ground,<br>
the Island, the Best of Bipeds. <a class='vjw' id='vjw79'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw219'></a> It’s possible to measure the<br>
ocean’s water by the gallon<br>
but not ever could one measure<br>
your knowledge, O Omniscient One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw80'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw220'></a> It’s possible to lift the earth<br>
onto a comparable sphere<br>
but not ever could one measure<br>
your knowledge, O Omniscient One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw81'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw221'></a> It’s possible to measure <span class='add'>all</span><br>
space with a rope or by the inch<br>
but not ever could one measure<br>
your knowledge, O Omniscient One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw82'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw222'></a> One might exhaust the entire earth<br>
and all the water in the sea<br>
but similes that might arise<br>
won’t befit the Buddha’s knowledge. <a class='vjw' id='vjw83'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw223'></a> Whatever goes on in the minds<br>
of this world’s creatures, with its gods,<br>
O Eyeful One all those things too<br>
are sunk in your knowledge-water. <a class='vjw' id='vjw84'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw224'></a> The knowledge by which you attained<br>
supreme complete Awakening:<br>
with that knowledge, Omniscient One,<br>
you crush rivals and heretics.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw85'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw225'></a> Having praised with these <span class='add'>nine</span> verses,<br>
the ascetic named Suruci<br>
spreading out his deer-leather robe<br>
sat down <span class='add'>right there</span> upon the earth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw86'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw226'></a> “They say the king of mountains rose<br>
to that height after being sunk<br>
in the great ocean for as long<br>
as eighty-four thousand aeons. <a class='vjw' id='vjw87'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw227'></a> And Meru, having thus arisen,<br>
being so long and so spread out,<br>
bit by bit gets broken into<br>
two million lakhs <span class='add'>of small pebbles</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw88'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw228'></a> If one should investigate it,<br>
counting the numbers of lakhs <span class='add'>there,</span><br>
<span class='add'>still</span> he could not ever measure<br>
your knowledge, O Omniscient One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw89'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw229'></a> Whichever water is encircled<br>
by water holes however small<br>
the beings who live in water<br>
would all <span class='add'>find themselves</span> submerged there. <a class='vjw' id='vjw90'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw230'></a> In just that way, O Great Hero,<br>
these ordinary heretics<br>
who jump into dogmas’ grasp<br>
get deluded by what they touch. <a class='vjw' id='vjw91'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw231'></a> These <span class='add'>heretics</span> pulled underwater<br>
by your knowledge which is pure and<br>
which is seen without obstruction<br>
never move beyond your knowledge.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw92'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw232'></a> At that time <span class='add'>he</span>, the Blessed One,<br>
Anomadassi, Greatly Famed,<br>
arising from his meditation,<br>
surveyed the <span class='add'>whole</span> world, that Victor. <a class='vjw' id='vjw93'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw233'></a> Nisabha was a follower<br>
of that Sage Anomadassi.<br>
He was surrounded by a lakh<br>
of peaceful-minded ones like him <a class='vjw' id='vjw94'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw234'></a> who’d destroyed defilements, were pure,<br>
and had the six special knowledges.<br>
Discerning the Buddha’s wishes<br>
he then approached that World-Leader. <a class='vjw' id='vjw95'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw235'></a> Standing up in the air right there<br>
they circumambulated him<br>
and praising with ten fingers pressed<br>
came down to the Buddha’s presence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw96'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw236'></a> Anomadassi, Blessed One,<br>
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,<br>
sitting in the monks’ Assembly<br>
<span class='add'>right then</span> made manifest a smile. <a class='vjw' id='vjw97'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw237'></a> Varuṇa was the attendant<br>
on the Omniscient One, Great Sage.<br>
Putting <span class='add'>his</span> robe on one shoulder<br>
he then queried the World-Leader: <a class='vjw' id='vjw98'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw238'></a> “O Blessed One, what is the cause<br>
of the Teacher’s <span class='add'>breaking a</span> smile?<br>
It never is without a cause<br>
that the Buddhas begin to smile.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw99'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw239'></a> Anomadassi, Blessed One,<br>
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,<br>
seated in the monks’ Assembly<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> spoke these verses <span class='add'>in reply</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw100'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw240'></a> “This one who honors me with flowers<br>
and also extols my knowledge,<br>
I shall relate details of him;<br>
<span class='add'>all of</span> you listen to my words.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw101'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw241'></a> Knowing that Buddha would speak, the<br>
gods all came together <span class='add'>there then</span>.<br>
Wishing to hear the great Teaching<br>
they <span class='add'>then</span> approached the Sambuddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw102'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw242'></a> Lesser gods in ten world-systems<br>
who possessed enormous powers<br>
wishing to hear the great Teaching<br>
also approached the Sambuddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw103'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw243'></a> <span class='add'>He said</span>, “The army, with four parts—<br>
tusker, soldier, chariot, horse—<br>
will ceaselessly wait on this one;<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw104'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw244'></a> Sixty thousand instruments <span class='add'>and</span><br>
well-decorated kettle-drums<br>
will always pay respects to him;<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw105'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw245'></a> Women numbering sixteen thousand,<br>
decked out in all the ornaments,<br>
with varied clothes and jewelry<br>
and wearing earrings made of gems <a class='vjw' id='vjw106'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw246'></a> with long eyelashes, lovely smiles<br>
and slim waists, pleasant to look at,<br>
will ceaselessly wait on this one:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw107'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw247'></a> He’ll delight in the world of gods<br>
for one hundred thousand aeons.<br>
A thousand times he’s going to be<br>
the wheel-turning king of a country. <a class='vjw' id='vjw108'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw248'></a> A thousand times the king of gods,<br>
he will exercise divine rule,<br>
<span class='add'>and he will have</span> much local rule<br>
innumerable by counting. <a class='vjw' id='vjw109'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw249'></a> When he attains his final birth<br>
he will go to the human state.<br>
He will be borne out of the womb<br>
of the brahmin woman Sāri. <a class='vjw' id='vjw110'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw250'></a> Thenceforth this man will be known by<br>
the name of his maternal clan:<br>
his name will be Sāriputta;<br>
he will have sharp intelligence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw111'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw251'></a> Giving up eight hundred million<br>
he will renounce, with nothing left,<br>
and searching for the path to peace<br>
this great man’s going to wander <span class='add'>far</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw112'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw252'></a> Aeons beyond measure from now,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw113'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw253'></a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
with the name of Sāriputta<br>
he’ll be the foremost follower. <a class='vjw' id='vjw114'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw254'></a> This river, the Bhāgīrathī,<br>
is fed by the Himalayas,<br>
rushes into the mighty sea,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> satisfies the great ocean. <a class='vjw' id='vjw115'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw255'></a> Just so this man, Sāriputta,<br>
wise one among the Sāketas<br>
attaining wisdom’s perfection<br>
will satisfy <span class='add'>all</span> living beings. <a class='vjw' id='vjw116'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw256'></a> Going from the Himalayas<br>
to the sea, the mighty ocean,<br>
whatever sand lies in between<br>
cannot be fathomed by counting. <a class='vjw' id='vjw117'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw257'></a> Without remainder he’ll be able<br>
to fathom that by counting thus;<br>
but there will be no upper limit<br>
to Sāriputta’s <span class='add'>own</span> wisdom. <a class='vjw' id='vjw118'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw258'></a> Counting by hundreds of thousands<br>
one would exhaust the Ganges’s sands;<br>
but there will be no upper limit<br>
to Sāriputta’s <span class='add'>own</span> wisdom. <a class='vjw' id='vjw119'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw259'></a> The waves upon the mighty ocean<br>

that too <span class='add'>he’ll do</span>! Sāriputta’s<br>
wisdom will have no upper limit. <a class='vjw' id='vjw120'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw260'></a> Satisfying the Sambuddha<br>
Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,<br>
he’ll attain wisdom’s perfection<br>
and be the foremost follower. <a class='vjw' id='vjw121'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw261'></a> Perfectly he’s going to follow<br>
the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-wheel which <span class='add'>will be</span> turned<br>
by the Śākyas’ Son, Neutral One,<br>
a <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-shower raining forth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw122'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw262'></a> Understanding all of that well,<br>
Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,<br>
seated in the monks’ Assembly<br>
will place him in the foremost place.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw123'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw263'></a> O see the deed I did so well<br>
for Teacher Anomadassi.<br>
Having done what he required<br>
in every place I did excel. <a class='vjw' id='vjw124'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw264'></a> Karma done immeasurable<br>
<span class='add'>aeons hence</span> showed me <span class='add'>its</span> fruit here:<br>
well-liberated, arrow-quick,<br>
I have destroyed my defilements. <a class='vjw' id='vjw125'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw265'></a> Searching for the unconditioned<br>
and unshaking state, nirvana,<br>
sussing out all the heretics<br>
I circled through existences. <a class='vjw' id='vjw126'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw266'></a> Just as a man, plagued with disease<br>
would investigate all the jungles<br>
searching for medicinal herbs<br>
to be released from his illness, <a class='vjw' id='vjw127'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw267'></a> searching for the unconditioned<br>
state of deathlessness, nirvana,<br>
without a break, five hundred times<br>
I went forth into sagely life. <a class='vjw' id='vjw128'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw268'></a> Bearing a weight of matted hair<br>
I wore a deer-leather garment;<br>
perfecting special knowledges<br>
I went to the world of Brahma. <a class='vjw' id='vjw129'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw269'></a> There’s nothing outside the wisdom<br>
laid down in the dispensation.<br>
Whatever being’s intelligent<br>
will discern the dispensation. <a class='vjw' id='vjw130'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw270'></a> Then I thought, “this is the method<br>
for that me, desiring the goal.”<br>
Searching for the unconditioned<br>
I wandered the difficult fords. <a class='vjw' id='vjw131'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw271'></a> Just as a man, wanting its pith,<br>
who chops and splits a banana tree<br>
would not thereby attain that pith<br>
but would be devoid of that pith, <a class='vjw' id='vjw132'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw272'></a> so too the world’s heretics<br>
with their varied views and big crowds<br>
lack that which is unconditioned<br>
like the banana tree lacks pith. <a class='vjw' id='vjw133'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw273'></a> When I reached <span class='add'>my</span> last existence<br>
I was a kinsman of Brahma.<br>
Throwing away a whole billion<br>
I went forth into homelessness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw134'></a></p>
<p class='endsection'>The First Recitation Portion.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw274'></a>There was a learned mantra-knower<br>
who had mastered the three Vedas,<br>
a brahmin known as Sañjaya.<br>
I dwelt in his vicinity. <a class='vjw' id='vjw135'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw275'></a> O Great Hero, your follower,<br>
the brahmin known as Assaji,<br>
hard to approach, with mighty powers<br>
always went about for alms <span class='add'>there</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw136'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw276'></a> I saw that one who was so wise,<br>
a sage well used to quietude,<br>
a peaceful-hearted elephant,<br>
just like a lotus flower in bloom. <a class='vjw' id='vjw137'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw277'></a> Having seen him I realized<br>
“this man will be a worthy one,<br>
well-tamed, whose mind is purified,<br>
a bull, most excellent, a hero. <a class='vjw' id='vjw138'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw278'></a> Pleasing in his mode of conduct,<br>
beautiful and well-self-controlled,<br>
tamed in the ultimate taming,<br>
a seer of deathlessness he’ll be. <a class='vjw' id='vjw139'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw279'></a> Why then do I not question him<br>
the happy one, about the goal?<br>
Questioned by me he will reply!”<br>
Then I am asking <span class='add'>him</span> questions. <a class='vjw' id='vjw140'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw280'></a> I proceeded to follow him<br>
as he wandered about for alms;<br>
I was honored with permission<br>
to ask about the deathless state. <a class='vjw' id='vjw141'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw281'></a> Approaching him along the road<br>
I questioned him in this way <span class='add'>then</span>:<br>
“Of which clan are you, O wise one?<br>
Whose pupil are you, happy one? <a class='vjw' id='vjw142'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw282'></a> Like a lion which is not frightened<br>
he, questioned by me, answered thus:<br>
“A Buddha’s risen in the world;<br>
I am his student, a follower.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw143'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw283'></a> “It would be excellent, wise one,<br>
o famous one, O <span class='add'>Buddha’s</span> son,<br>
if you’d please declare to me, sir,<br>
the sort of Teaching Buddha teaches.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw144'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw284'></a> Questioned by me he <span class='add'>then</span> declared<br>
the entire deep and subtle state<br>
in which all suffering’s destroyed<br>
and craving’s arrow is removed. <a class='vjw' id='vjw145'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw285'></a> “The Thus-Gone-One did speak about<br>
the basic causes of all things<br>
and the ceasing of those causes;<br>
that is what the Great Monk declares.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw146'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw286'></a> When my question had been answered<br>
I had attained the first path-fruit.<br>
Having heard the dispensation,<br>
I was free of stain and blemish. <a class='vjw' id='vjw147'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw287'></a> After hearing the sage’s speech,<br>
having seen the superb Teaching,<br>
well-immersed in that Great Teaching<br>
I uttered these verses <span class='add'>aloud</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw148'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw288'></a> “Even if this Teaching goes only this far<br>
you all should discern <span class='add'>its</span> grief-free state<br>
as not seen in the past<br>
performing many sacrifices. <a class='vjw' id='vjw149'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw289'></a>While seeking <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i> <span class='add'>formerly</span><br>
I wandered the difficult fords.<br>
That meaning’s <span class='add'>now</span> obtained by me;<br>
there is no time for neglecting.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw150'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw290'></a> Greatly pleased by <span class='add'>monk</span> Assaji,<br>
attaining to that tranquil state,<br>
looking for my co-renouncer<br>
I returned to the ashram <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw151'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw291'></a> On seeing me from far away<br>
my companion, who was well-trained,<br>
who’d learned meditative postures,<br>
<span class='add'>astonished</span>, spoke these words <span class='add'>to me</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw152'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw292'></a> “O sage your face and eyes are pleased<br>
and you display a sagely mien.<br>
How have you come to deathlessness,<br>
everlasting state, nirvana?” <a class='vjw' id='vjw153'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw293'></a> You come, conforming to what’s good,<br>
it is as though you’ve been made calm.<br>
And you’ve approached <span class='add'>me</span>, O brahmin,<br>
tamed in the ultimate taming.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw154'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw294'></a> “I have attained the deathless state<br>
where craving’s arrow is destroyed.<br>
You too ought to attain <span class='add'>to that</span>;<br>
let’s go to the Teacher’s presence.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw155'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw295'></a> My companion, who was well-trained,<br>
assented saying “Excellent!”<br>
Taking <span class='add'>his</span> hand into <span class='add'>my</span> hand<br>
we went to the Teacher’s presence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw156'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw296'></a> “We both of us will now go forth<br>
in your presence, O Śākyas’ Son.<br>
Having arrived at your teaching<br>
we will live without defilements.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw157'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw297'></a> Kolita’s top in magic powers;<br>
I’m the one foremost in wisdom.<br>
The two of us, living as one,<br>
beautify the dispensation. <a class='vjw' id='vjw158'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw298'></a> While my thought was still incomplete<br>
I wandered the difficult fords.<br>
Coming to your philosophy<br>
my thought is now fully mature. <a class='vjw' id='vjw159'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw299'></a> Having been planted in the earth,<br>
trees blossom forth in <span class='add'>their</span> season.<br>
They exude their heavenly scents<br>
and delight all living beings. <a class='vjw' id='vjw160'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw300'></a> In just this way, O Great Hero,<br>
O Greatly Famed One, Śākyas’ Son,<br>
being planted in your teaching<br>
I want to bear flowers in season. <a class='vjw' id='vjw161'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw301'></a> I seek the liberation-flower,<br>
freedom from this circling rebirth.<br>
Finding that liberation-flower<br>
I’ll delight all living beings. <a class='vjw' id='vjw162'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw302'></a> Through this entire Buddha-field<br>
except for the Great Sage himself,<br>
in wisdom there is no rival<br>
for <span class='add'>me</span>, your son, O Eyeful One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw163'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw303'></a> Well-instructed are your students;<br>
the retinue is so well-trained.<br>
Tamed in the ultimate taming<br>
they always gather around you. <a class='vjw' id='vjw164'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw304'></a> Meditators, trance-lovers,<br>
wise, attentive, with minds at peace,<br>
sages who have a sagely mien,<br>
they always gather around you. <a class='vjw' id='vjw165'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw305'></a> Wanting little, clever and wise,<br>
eating little, with no desires,<br>
happy if receiving or not,<br>
they always gather around you. <a class='vjw' id='vjw166'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw306'></a> Forest dwellers with wants removed,<br>
meditators in shabby robes<br>
who delight in being alone,<br>
they always gather around you. <a class='vjw' id='vjw167'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw307'></a> Attainers of the eight path-fruits<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> those who are still aspiring,<br>
searching for the ultimate goal<br>
they always gather around you. <a class='vjw' id='vjw168'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw308'></a> Stainless enterers of the stream<br>
and some who are once-returners;<br>
non-returners and arahants too,<br>
they always gather around you. <a class='vjw' id='vjw169'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw309'></a> Skilled in retaining mindfulness,<br>
fond of wisdom’s parts as focus,<br>
your followers all, and numerous,<br>
they always gather around you. <a class='vjw' id='vjw170'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw310'></a> Skilled in <span class='add'>all</span> the superpowers,<br>
fond of calming-meditation,<br>
undertaking fit exertion<br>
they always gather around you. <a class='vjw' id='vjw171'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw311'></a> Perfecting the three knowledges,<br>
special knowledges, superpowers,<br>
attaining wisdom’s perfection<br>
they always gather around you. <a class='vjw' id='vjw172'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw312'></a> Such indeed are they, Great Hero,<br>
your students, who are so well-trained,<br>
hard to approach, with mighty powers,<br>
they always gather around you. <a class='vjw' id='vjw173'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw313'></a> Surrounded by <span class='add'>all</span> those students<br>
ascetics who have been taught well,<br>
like a lion which is not frightened<br>
you shine just like the king of stars. <a class='vjw' id='vjw174'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw314'></a> Having been planted in the earth,<br>
hardwood trees grow up <span class='add'>strong and tall</span>.<br>
They attain their full abundance<br>
and <span class='add'>in season</span> display their fruit. <a class='vjw' id='vjw175'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw315'></a> O Śākyas’ Son, O Great Famed One,<br>
you’re analogous to the earth;<br>
being fixed in your <span class='add'>great</span> teaching,<br>
they <span class='add'>like the trees</span> grow deathless fruit. <a class='vjw' id='vjw176'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw316'></a> The Indus, and the Sarasvatī<br>
are rivers, like the Candabhāgā,<br>
the Ganges and the Yamuna<br>
the Sarabhu and the Mahī too. <a class='vjw' id='vjw177'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw317'></a> When those rivers <span class='add'>finish</span> flowing<br>
the great ocean accepts them <span class='add'>all</span>.<br>
Abandoning their former names,<br>
they’re all known as “the great ocean”. <a class='vjw' id='vjw178'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw318'></a> Likewise these people, of four castes,<br>
who’ve gone forth into your presence,<br>
abandoning their former names<br>
are all known as “the Buddha’s sons”. <a class='vjw' id='vjw179'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw319'></a> Just as the moon which is unblemished<br>
going across the space in the sky<br>
casting its light upon the world<br>
outshines the entire mass of stars, <a class='vjw' id='vjw180'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw320'></a> so likewise you, O Great Hero,<br>
surrounded by the gods and men,<br>
going across the Buddha-field<br>
are shining brightly all the time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw181'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw321'></a> Waves which <span class='add'>first</span> arise from the depths<br>
go no further than the seashore;<br>
when they do come onto the shore,<br>
they are crushed to bits and scattered. <a class='vjw' id='vjw182'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw322'></a> Just so the world’s heretics<br>
with their varied views and big crowds<br>
wishing to possess the Teaching<br>
never go further than the Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw183'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw323'></a> If they <span class='add'>try</span> attaining to that<br>
through debating, O Eyeful One,<br>
having come into your presence<br>
they get thoroughly crushed by you. <a class='vjw' id='vjw184'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw324'></a> Just as many white lotuses<br>
and <i lang='pli' translate='no'>mandālaka</i> blooms, water-born,<br>
do get besmeared by the water<br>
and also by the mud and clay, <a class='vjw' id='vjw185'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw325'></a> so too indeed many creatures<br>
who’re born and grow up in the world<br>
are pained by <span class='add'>their</span> lust and anger<br>
like the white lotus in the mud. <a class='vjw' id='vjw186'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw326'></a> Just as a pink lotus, water-born,<br>
growing up in the water’s midst<br>
is not besmeared by the water<br>
but rather that lotus is clean, <a class='vjw' id='vjw187'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw327'></a> so too are you, O Great Hero,<br>
though born within the world, Great Sage.<br>
You are not besmeared by the world,<br>
like the pink lotus by water. <a class='vjw' id='vjw188'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw328'></a> Likewise, many lotus flowers<br>
blossom in the month of April<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> do not last beyond that month;<br>
that is the time for blossoming. <a class='vjw' id='vjw189'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw329'></a> So too are you, O Śākyas’ Son<br>
blooming in your liberation.<br>
The dispensation’s not surpassed<br>
like the water-born lotuses. <a class='vjw' id='vjw190'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw330'></a> The king of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>sal</i> trees all in bloom<br>
exudes a heavenly perfume.<br>
Surrounded by other <i lang='pli' translate='no'>sal</i> trees<br>
the king of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>sal</i> trees is lovely. <a class='vjw' id='vjw191'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw331'></a> So too are you, O Great Hero,<br>
blooming with a Buddha’s wisdom.<br>
Circled by the monks’ Assembly,<br>
like the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>sal</i>-king you are lovely. <a class='vjw' id='vjw192'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw332'></a> Just as the Himalayan stone’s<br>
medicine for living beings<br>
and the lair of the lesser gods,<br>
and <i lang='pli' translate='no'>nāgas</i> and <i lang='pli' translate='no'>asurās</i> too, <a class='vjw' id='vjw193'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw333'></a> so too are you, O Great Hero,<br>
medicine for living beings;<br>
you’ve mastered the three knowledges,<br>
special knowledges, great powers. <a class='vjw' id='vjw194'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw334'></a> They are admonished, Great Hero,<br>
by you, <span class='add'>but</span> with <span class='add'>great</span> compassion.<br>
Delighting in love of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i><br>
they dwell in your dispensation. <a class='vjw' id='vjw195'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw335'></a> Likewise a lion, king of beasts,<br>
going about how he wishes,<br>
surveying the four directions<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> growls three times <span class='add'>his mighty roar</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw196'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw336'></a> All the beasts are very frightened<br>
because of that lion’s growling.<br>
Thus just one beast, of noble birth<br>
always frightens <span class='add'>all of the rest</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw197'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw337'></a> Because of your growl, Great Hero,<br>
the earth <span class='add'>herself</span> begins to quake.<br>
Those fit for wisdom realize it,<br>
scaring the partisans of Death. <a class='vjw' id='vjw198'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw338'></a> The heretics are all afraid<br>
of your voice, O Sage so Great.<br>
That flock of crows is in a fluster<br>
like the beasts with the lion-king. <a class='vjw' id='vjw199'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw339'></a> Those with followers in the world<br>
are known by the title “teachers”.<br>
They teach to their community<br>
doctrines passed down by tradition. <a class='vjw' id='vjw200'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw340'></a> Not so do you, O Great Hero<br>
preach your Teaching to living beings.<br>
Understanding the truths yourself<br>
<span class='add'>you preach</span> all of Awakening. <a class='vjw' id='vjw201'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw341'></a> Grasping desires and deep fantasies,<br>
strengths and weaknesses of senses,<br>
discerning who’s able, who’s not,<br>
you thunder forth like a great cloud. <a class='vjw' id='vjw202'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw342'></a> Right to the universe’s edge,<br>
seated groups of followers are<br>
thinking through their varied doctrines,<br>
trying to resolve <span class='add'>all</span> their doubts. <a class='vjw' id='vjw203'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw343'></a> Reading the minds of everyone,<br>
skilled in analogies, O Sage,<br>
discoursing on single questions<br>
you resolve living beings’ doubts. <a class='vjw' id='vjw204'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw344'></a> In this world the earth is filled with<br>
people like those <span class='add'>I’ve</span> referred to.<br>
All of them, hands reverently pressed,<br>
should sing the World-Leader’s praises. <a class='vjw' id='vjw205'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw345'></a> Singing praises for an entire aeon,<br>
speaking of diverse qualities<br>
they never could be fully measured;<br>
the Thus-Gone-One has no measure. <a class='vjw' id='vjw206'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw346'></a> Thus singing the Victor’s praises<br>
with all the power that they have,<br>
speaking for ten million aeons<br>
this and that would remain unsaid. <a class='vjw' id='vjw207'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw347'></a> If any being, god or man,<br>
even if he’s <span class='add'>very</span> well-trained<br>
tries to draw the full <span class='add'>ocean’s water</span><br>
he would certainly come to grief. <a class='vjw' id='vjw208'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw348'></a> <span class='add'>Now</span> fixed in your dispensation,<br>
O Śākyas’ Son, O Great Famed One<br>
having reached Wisdom’s Perfection<br>
I’m living without defilements. <a class='vjw' id='vjw209'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw349'></a> Defeating rival heretics<br>
I further the dispensation.<br>
Today I’m the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s general<br>
in the Buddha’s dispensation. <a class='vjw' id='vjw210'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw350'></a> Karma done immeasurable<br>
<span class='add'>aeons hence</span> showed me <span class='add'>its</span> fruit here:<br>
well-liberated, arrow-quick,<br>
I have destroyed my defilements. <a class='vjw' id='vjw211'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw351'></a> Whatever man who on his head<br>
would carry a load, every day,<br>
he’d be oppressed due to that load,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> that burden would be heavy. <a class='vjw' id='vjw212'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw352'></a> I transmigrated through lifetimes<br>
being burnt up by the three fires,<br>
weighed down by the burden of being<br>
as though I were lifting mountains. <a class='vjw' id='vjw213'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw353'></a> My burden <span class='add'>now</span> has been laid down<br>
and I’ve destroyed re-becoming.<br>
I’ve done all things that should be done<br>
in the Buddha’s dispensation. <a class='vjw' id='vjw214'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw354'></a> Through this entire Buddha-field,<br>
except the Śākyan Bull himself,<br>
I’m supreme in terms of wisdom;<br>
there is no one to rival me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw215'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw355'></a> So well-trained in meditation<br>
excelling in the superpowers,<br>
today my only desire is to<br>
create a thousand magically. <a class='vjw' id='vjw216'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw356'></a> Of me who dwelt there by and by<br>
the Great Sage was the <span class='add'>great</span> Teacher.<br>
He told me the dispensation;<br>
cessation happened lying down. <a class='vjw' id='vjw217'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw357'></a> My divine eye is purified<br>
and I’m skilled in concentration.<br>
Proper exertion is applied;<br>
I love wisdom’s parts as focus. <a class='vjw' id='vjw218'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw358'></a> Everything is done by me<br>
which followers ought to attain.<br>
Except the Leader of the World<br>
there is no one to rival me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw219'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw359'></a> Skilled in the attainments and discipline,<br>
through altered states I got liberated fast.<br>
Fond of wisdom’s parts as focus<br>
I’ve excelled in the followers’ virtues. <a class='vjw' id='vjw220'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw360'></a>Attaining the followers’ virtues<br>
I’m honored by the Best of Men.<br>
<span class='add'>My</span> mind is always filled with faith<br>
in fellow religious students. <a class='vjw' id='vjw221'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw361'></a> Like a snake whose poison’s destroyed,<br>
like a bull whose horns are broken,<br>
freed of my pride and arrogance<br>
I approach with great reverence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw222'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw362'></a> If my wisdom were a beautiful girl<br>
she’d hook up with the rulers of earth.<br>
This is the fruit of <span class='add'>my</span> having praised the<br>
knowledge of Anomadassi Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw223'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw363'></a>I help keep rolling perfectly<br>
the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-wheel which was turned<br>
by the Śākyas’ Son, Neutral One:<br>
that’s the fruit of praising knowledge. <a class='vjw' id='vjw224'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw364'></a> May I not ever, anywhere,<br>
meet one whose thoughts are less than pure,<br>
who’s lazy or lacks energy,<br>
is unlearned or immoral. <a class='vjw' id='vjw225'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw365'></a> Let only one who is learned,<br>
wise, well-fixed in moral precepts<br>
and settled into mental calm<br>
come face-to-face in front of me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw226'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw366'></a> I’m saying this to you, O monks,<br>
gathered together begging here:<br>
always be happy, with slight wants,<br>
meditators, trance-lovers. <a class='vjw' id='vjw227'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw367'></a> That one whom I saw first of all<br>
was free of lust and stainless <span class='add'>too</span>.<br>
He’s my teacher, he’s the hero,<br>
the follower named Assaji. <a class='vjw' id='vjw228'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw368'></a> It’s on account of him that I<br>
today am <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s general.<br>
In every place, having excelled,<br>
I’m living without defilements. <a class='vjw' id='vjw229'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw369'></a> I bow my head in reverence<br>
to whatever region he’s in,<br>
that one who was my own teacher,<br>
the follower named Assaji. <a class='vjw' id='vjw230'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw370'></a> Having called to mind my karma,<br>
Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,<br>
seated in the monks’ Assembly<br>
placed <span class='add'>me</span> in the foremost place <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw231'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw371'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw372'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught!</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw373'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw232'></a></p>
