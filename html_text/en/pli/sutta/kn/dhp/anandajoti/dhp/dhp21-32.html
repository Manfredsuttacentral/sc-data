<h1>The Chapter about Heedfulness</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc21' data-uid='dhp21'></a>Heedfulness is the deathless state, heedlessness the state of the dead,<br>
the heedful do not die, <span class='add'>but</span> those who are heedless are as if dead.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc22' data-uid='dhp22'></a>The wise, understanding this difference in regard to heedfulness,<br>
rejoice in heedfulness, delight in the domain of the Noble Ones.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc23' data-uid='dhp23'></a>Those who meditate all the time, constant and firm in their effort,<br>
those wise ones reach Nibbāna, the unsurpassed release from <span class='add'>all</span> bonds.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc24' data-uid='dhp24'></a>For he who is active, mindful,<br>
pure in deeds, considerate,<br>
self-controlled, living by Dhamma,<br>
heedful, fame greatly increases.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc25' data-uid='dhp25'></a>Through activity, heedfulness, through self-control and through restraint,<br>
the sage should make an island that no flood waters can overcome.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc26' data-uid='dhp26'></a>The foolish and stupid people cultivate heedlessness,<br>
but the sagacious one guards heedfulness just as his greatest wealth.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc27' data-uid='dhp27'></a>Do not cultivate heedlessness, do not be acquainted with delight in sensual pleasure,<br>
for the heedful one, meditating, <span class='add'>surely</span> attains great happiness.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc28' data-uid='dhp28'></a>When the wise one eliminates heedlessness with his heedfulness,<br>
and mounts the palace of wisdom, griefless, <span class='add'>he looks</span> on grieving people;<br>
the wise one, like one standing on a mountain, looks down on the fools, who are standing on the plains.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc29' data-uid='dhp29'></a>Heedful amongst the heedless ones, wakeful amongst the ones who sleep,<br>
like a swift horse who abandons a weak horse, the true sage moves on.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc30' data-uid='dhp30'></a>Through heedfulness Maghavā attained leadership of the gods,<br>
<span class='add'>the good</span> praise heedfulness, <span class='add'>but</span> heedlessness is always blamed.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc31' data-uid='dhp31'></a>A monastic who delights in heedfulness, seeing danger in heedlessness,<br>
advances like burning fire against the fetter, small or large.<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc32' data-uid='dhp32'></a>A monastic who delights in heedfulness, seeing danger in heedlessness,<br>
is unable to fall away: he is well-nigh to Nibbāna.</p>
