<h1>The Chapter about the World</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc167' data-uid='dhp167'></a>One should not follow lowly things, one should not abide heedlessly,<br>
one should not follow a wrong view, one should not foster worldliness.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc168' data-uid='dhp168'></a>One should strive, not be heedless, one should live by Dhamma, with good conduct,<br>
living by Dhamma one lives at ease in this world and the next.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc169' data-uid='dhp169'></a>One should live by Dhamma, with good conduct, not with bad conduct,<br>
living by Dhamma one lives at ease in this world and the next.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc170' data-uid='dhp170'></a>One should see it as a bubble, one should see it as a mirage,<br>
looking on the world in this way the King of Death does not see <span class='add'>one</span>.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc171' data-uid='dhp171'></a>Come, look upon this world adorned like a king’s gilded chariot,<br>
where fools become depressed – there is no bond for those who understand.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc172' data-uid='dhp172'></a>Whoever was heedless before, but later is not heedless,<br>
that one shines brightly on this world like the moon released from a cloud.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc173' data-uid='dhp173'></a>The one whose wicked deed is covered over by a good deed –<br>
that one shines brightly on this world like the moon released from a cloud.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc174' data-uid='dhp174'></a>This world is blind, few here have true insight,<br>
as few go to heaven as birds that escape from the net.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc175' data-uid='dhp175'></a>Geese go through the path of the sky, they go through the firmament by their power,<br>
the wise are led out of the world, after beating Māra and his host.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc176' data-uid='dhp176'></a>For the person speaking falsely, who has transgressed in this one thing,<br>
who has abandoned the next world, there is no wickedness left undone.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc177' data-uid='dhp177'></a>The miserly go not to the world of the gods,<br>
fools surely do not praise giving,<br>
but the wise one rejoices in giving,<br>
and through that he is happy hereafter.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc178' data-uid='dhp178'></a>Having sole sovereignty over the earth, or going to heaven,<br>
or lordship over the whole world – better is the fruit of stream-entry.</p>
