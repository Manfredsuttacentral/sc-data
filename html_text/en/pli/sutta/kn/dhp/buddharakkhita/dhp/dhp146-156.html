<p><a class='sc' id='146' data-uid='dhp146'></a>When this world is ever ablaze, why this laughter, why this jubilation? Shrouded in darkness, will you not see the light?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='147' data-uid='dhp147'></a>Behold this body—a painted image, a mass of heaped up sores, infirm, full of hankering—of which nothing is lasting or stable!</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='148' data-uid='dhp148'></a>Fully worn out is this body, a nest of disease, and fragile. This foul mass breaks up, for death is the end of life.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='149' data-uid='dhp149'></a>These dove-colored bones are like gourds that lie scattered about in autumn. Having seen them, how can one seek delight?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='150' data-uid='dhp150'></a>This city (body) is built of bones, plastered with flesh and blood; within are decay and death, pride and jealousy.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='151' data-uid='dhp151'></a>Even gorgeous royal chariots wear out, and indeed this body too wears out. But the Dhamma of the Good does not age; thus the Good make it known to the good.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='152' data-uid='dhp152'></a>The man of little learning grows old like a bull. He grows only in bulk, but, his wisdom does not grow.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='153' data-uid='dhp153'></a>Through many a birth in samsara have I wandered in vain, seeking the builder of this house (of life). Repeated birth is indeed suffering!</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='154' data-uid='dhp154'></a>O house-builder, you are seen! You will not build this house again. For your rafters are broken and your ridgepole shattered. My mind has reached the Unconditioned; I have attained the destruction of craving.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='155' data-uid='dhp155'></a>Those who in youth have not led the holy life, or have failed to acquire wealth, languish like old cranes in the pond without fish.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='156' data-uid='dhp156'></a>Those who in youth have not lead the holy life, or have failed to acquire wealth, lie sighing over the past, like worn out arrows (shot from) a bow.</p>
