<h1>The World</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='167' data-uid='dhp167'></a>Follow not the vulgar way; live not in heedlessness; hold not false views; linger not long in worldly existence.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='168' data-uid='dhp168'></a>Arise! Do not be heedless! Lead a righteous life. The righteous live happily both in this world and the next.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='169' data-uid='dhp169'></a>Lead a righteous life; lead not a base life. The righteous live happily both in this world and the next.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='170' data-uid='dhp170'></a>One who looks upon the world as a bubble and a mirage, him the King of Death sees not.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='171' data-uid='dhp171'></a>Come! Behold this world, which is like a decorated royal chariot. Here fools flounder, but the wise have no attachment to it.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='172' data-uid='dhp172'></a>He who having been heedless is heedless no more, illuminates this world like the moon freed from clouds.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='173' data-uid='dhp173'></a>He, who by good deeds covers the evil he has done, illuminates this world like the moon freed from clouds.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='174' data-uid='dhp174'></a>Blind is the world; here only a few possess insight. Only a few, like birds escaping from the net, go to realms of bliss.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='175' data-uid='dhp175'></a>Swans fly on the path of the sun; men pass through the air by psychic powers; the wise are led away from the world after vanquishing Mara and his host.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='176' data-uid='dhp176'></a>For a liar who has violated the one law (of truthfulness) who holds in scorn the hereafter, there is no evil that he cannot do.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='177' data-uid='dhp177'></a>Truly, misers fare not to heavenly realms; nor, indeed, do fools praise generosity. But the wise man rejoices in giving, and by that alone does he become happy hereafter.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='178' data-uid='dhp178'></a>Better than sole sovereignty over the earth, better than going to heaven, better even than lordship over all the worlds is the supramundane Fruition of Stream Entrance.</p>
