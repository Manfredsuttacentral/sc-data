<h1>The Just</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='256' data-uid='dhp256'></a>Not by passing arbitrary judgments does a man become just; a wise man is he who investigates both right and wrong.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='257' data-uid='dhp257'></a>He who does not judge others arbitrarily, but passes judgment impartially according to the truth, that sagacious man is a guardian of law and is called just.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='258' data-uid='dhp258'></a>One is not wise because one speaks much. He who is peaceable, friendly and fearless is called wise.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='259' data-uid='dhp259'></a>A man is not versed in Dhamma because he speaks much. He who, after hearing a little Dhamma, realizes its truth directly and is not heedless of it, is truly versed in the Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='260' data-uid='dhp260'></a>A monk is not an elder because his head is gray. He is but ripe in age, and he is called one grown old in vain.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='261' data-uid='dhp261'></a>One in whom there is truthfulness, virtue, inoffensiveness, restraint and self-mastery, who is free from defilements and is wise—he is truly called an Elder.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='262' data-uid='dhp262'></a>Not by mere eloquence nor by beauty of form does a man become accomplished, if he is jealous, selfish and deceitful.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='263' data-uid='dhp263'></a>But he in whom these are wholly destroyed, uprooted and extinct, and who has cast out hatred—that wise man is truly accomplished.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='264' data-uid='dhp264'></a>Not by shaven head does a man who is indisciplined and untruthful become a monk. How can he who is full of desire and greed be a monk?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='265' data-uid='dhp265'></a>He who wholly subdues evil both small and great is called a monk, because he has overcome all evil.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='266' data-uid='dhp266'></a>He is not a monk just because he lives on others’ alms. Not by adopting outward form does one become a true monk.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='267' data-uid='dhp267'></a>Whoever here (in the Dispensation) lives a holy life, transcending both merit and demerit, and walks with understanding in this world—he is truly called a monk.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='268' data-uid='dhp268'></a>Not by observing silence does one become a sage, if he be foolish and ignorant. But that man is wise who, as if holding a balance-scale accepts only the good.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='269' data-uid='dhp269'></a>The sage (thus) rejecting the evil, is truly a sage. Since he comprehends both (present and future) worlds, he is called a sage.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='270' data-uid='dhp270'></a>He is not noble who injures living beings. He is called noble because he is harmless towards all living beings.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='271' data-uid='dhp271'></a><a class='sc' id='272' data-uid='dhp272'></a>Not by rules and observances, not even by much learning, nor by gain of absorption, nor by a life of seclusion, nor by thinking, “I enjoy the bliss of renunciation, which is not experienced by the worldling” should you, O monks, rest content, until the utter destruction of cankers (Arahantship) is reached.</p>
