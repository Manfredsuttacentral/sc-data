<h1>Anger</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='221' data-uid='dhp221'></a>One should give up anger, renounce pride, and overcome all fetters. Suffering never befalls him who clings not to mind and body and is detached.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='222' data-uid='dhp222'></a>He who checks rising anger as a charioteer checks a rolling chariot, him I call a true charioteer. Others only hold the reins.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='223' data-uid='dhp223'></a>Overcome the angry by non-anger; overcome the wicked by goodness; overcome the miser by generosity; overcome the liar by truth.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='224' data-uid='dhp224'></a>Speak the truth; yield not to anger; when asked, give even if you only have a little. By these three means can one reach the presence of the gods.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='225' data-uid='dhp225'></a>Those sages who are inoffensive and ever restrained in body, go to the Deathless State, where, having gone, they grieve no more.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='226' data-uid='dhp226'></a>Those who are ever vigilant, who discipline themselves day and night, and are ever intent upon Nibbana—their defilements fade away.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='227' data-uid='dhp227'></a>O Atula! Indeed, this is an ancient practice, not one only of today: they blame those who remain silent, they blame those who speak much, they blame those who speak in moderation. There is none in the world who is not blamed.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='228' data-uid='dhp228'></a>There never was, there never will be, nor is there now, a person who is wholly blamed or wholly praised.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='229' data-uid='dhp229'></a>But the man whom the wise praise, after observing him day after day, is one of flawless character, wise, and endowed with knowledge and virtue.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='230' data-uid='dhp230'></a>Who can blame such a one, as worthy as a coin of refined gold? Even the gods praise him; by Brahma, too, is he praised.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='231' data-uid='dhp231'></a>Let a man guard himself against irritability in bodily action; let him be controlled in deed. Abandoning bodily misconduct, let him practice good conduct in deed.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='232' data-uid='dhp232'></a>Let a man guard himself against irritability in speech; let him be controlled in speech. Abandoning verbal misconduct, let him practice good conduct in speech.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='233' data-uid='dhp233'></a>Let a man guard himself against irritability in thought; let him be controlled in mind. Abandoning mental misconduct, let him practice good conduct in thought.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='234' data-uid='dhp234'></a>The wise are controlled in bodily action, controlled in speech and controlled in thought. They are truly well-controlled.</p>
