<h1>Loving-kindness</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><a class='vns' id='vns143'></a>What should be done by one<br>
who is skilled in wholesomeness,<br>
to gain the State of Peacefulness is this:<br>
One should be able, upright, straight and not proud,<br>
easy to speak to, mild and well content,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns144'></a>easily satisfied and not caught up<br>
in too much bustle, and frugal in one’s ways,<br>
with senses calmed, intelligent, not bold,<br>
not being covetous when with other folk,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns145'></a>not even doing little things that other wise ones blame.<br>
(And this the thought that one should always hold):<br>
“May beings all live happily and safe,<br>
and may their hearts rejoice within themselves.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns146'></a>Whatever there may be with breath of life,<br>
whether they be frail or very strong,<br>
without exception, be they long or short,<br>
or middle-sized, or be big or small,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns147'></a>or dense, or visible or invisible,<br>
or whether they dwell far or they dwell near,<br>
those that are here, those seeking to exist—<br>
may beings all rejoice within themselves.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns148'></a>Let no one bring about another’s ruin<br>
and not despise in any way or place;<br>
let them not wish each other any ill<br>
from provocation or from enmity.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a><a class='vns' id='vns149'></a>Just as a mother at the risk of life<br>
loves and protects her child, her only child,<br>
so one should cultivate this boundless love<br>
to all that live in the whole universe—</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a><a class='vns' id='vns150'></a>extending from a consciousness sublime<br>
upwards and downwards and across the world,<br>
untroubled, free from hate and enmity.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9'></a><a class='vns' id='vns151'></a>And while one stands and while one sits<br>
or when one lies down still free from drowsiness,<br>
one should be intent on this mindfulness—<br>
this is divine abiding here they say.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc10'></a><a class='vns' id='vns152'></a>But when one lives quite free from any view,<br>
is virtuous, with perfect insight won,<br>
and greed for selfish desires let go,<br>
one surely comes no more to be reborn.</p>
