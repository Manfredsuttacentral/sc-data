<p><a class='jw' id='jw639'></a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
was a Master of Everything.<br>
<span class='add'>That</span> Leader arose in the world<br>
one hundred thousand aeons hence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw640'></a> I was born in Haṃsavatī,<br>
in a clan of millionaires then,<br>
glistening with various gems,<br>
endowed with supreme happiness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw641'></a> Having approached that Great Hero,<br>
I heard <span class='add'>him</span> preaching the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>.<br>
Then, pleasure born <span class='add'>in my heart,</span> I<br>
approached the Victor for refuge. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw642'></a> Then the Great Compassionate One,<br>
the Leader, Padumuttara,<br>
fixed a nun in the foremost <span class='add'>place</span><br>
of those with quick intuition. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw643'></a> Hearing that, being overjoyed,<br>
having given the Great Sage alms,<br>
bowing <span class='add'>my</span> head down at <span class='add'>his</span> feet<br>
I aspired to <span class='add'>attain</span> that place. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw644'></a> The Great Hero approved <span class='add'>of that</span>:<br>
“Lucky one, there will be success<br>
in everything for which you wish.<br>
Be happy, <span class='add'>you should feel</span> appeased. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw645'></a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw646'></a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
named Bhaddākuṇḍalakesā<br>
you’ll be the Teacher’s follower.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw647'></a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw648'></a> Fallen thence, I went to Yāma,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> then I went to Tusita,<br>
and then to Nimmānarati,<br>
and then Vāsavatti city. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw649'></a> In whichever place I’m reborn,<br>
in accordance with that karma,<br>
everyplace I was made chief queen<br>
of <span class='add'>the gods who were</span> the kings <span class='add'>there</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw650'></a> Fallen thence, in the human state,<br>
<span class='add'>everyplace</span> I was made chief queen<br>
of kings who turn the wheel <span class='add'>of law,</span><br>
and <span class='add'>powerful</span> regional kings. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw651'></a> Having experienced success,<br>
among gods as well as humans,<br>
becoming happy everywhere,<br>
I transmigrated for aeons. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw652'></a> In this <span class='add'>present</span> lucky aeon,<br>
Brahma’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,<br>
<span class='add'>the Buddha</span> known as Kassapa<br>
was born, the Best of Debaters. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw653'></a> The attendant of the Great Sage<br>
was the ruler of men back then,<br>
the king of Kāsi, named Kiki,<br>
in Benares, greatest city. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw654'></a> I was <span class='add'>then</span> that <span class='add'>king’s</span> fourth daughter,<br>
well-known as Bhikkhadāyikā.<br>
Hearing the Best Victor’s Teaching,<br>
I chose <span class='add'>to seek</span> ordination. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw655-656'></a> Our father did not permit it;<br>
we <span class='add'>stayed</span> at home during that time,<br>
comfortable royal maidens<br>
doing <span class='add'>our</span> practice with vigor<br>
in virginal celibacy,<br>
for twenty times a thousand years,<br>
fond of waiting on the Buddha,<br>
<span class='add'>the king’s</span> seven joyful daughters. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17-18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw657'></a> Samaṇī, and Samaṇaguttā,<br>
Bhikkhunī, Bhikkhadāyikā,<br>
Dhammā, and also Sudhammā,<br>
and seventh Saṅghadāyikā, <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw658'></a> <span class='add'>now</span> Uppalavaṇṇā, Khemā<br>
<span class='add'>also</span> Paṭācārā and I,<br>
Kisāgotamī, Dhammadinnā,<br>
and Visākhā is the seventh. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw659'></a> Due to those karmas done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw660'></a> And now, in <span class='add'>my</span> final rebirth,<br>
in Giribbaja, best city,<br>
<span class='add'>I was</span> born to rich millionaires.<br>
When I’d become a young woman, <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw661'></a> attracted to a thief I saw<br>
being led to execution,<br>
my father, <span class='add'>paying</span> a thousand,<br>
had him freed from execution. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw662'></a> After that, discerning my mind,<br>
<span class='add'>my father</span> gave me to that <span class='add'>thief</span>.<br>
I was trustworthy for him, <span class='add'>and</span><br>
extremely kindly <span class='add'>and</span> friendly. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw663'></a> He, out of greed for my jewels,<br>
that enemy with ill-intent,<br>
led me to the thieves’ precipice<br>
on a mountain, plotting murder. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw664'></a> Then stretching out to Sattuka,<br>
hands which were well pressed together,<br>
protecting <span class='add'>my</span> own breath <span class='add'>of life,</span><br>
I spoke these words <span class='add'>to him just then:</span> <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw665'></a> “This bracelet which is made of gold,<br>
<span class='add'>containing</span> many pearls and gems,<br>
Sir, carry all of this away;<br>
announce that <span class='add'>I’m your</span> bed-slave.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw666'></a> “Take it off, O beautiful one,<br>
and do not feel a lot of grief;<br>
I am unable to accept<br>
wealth that I did not kill to get. <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw667'></a> For as long as I remember,<br>
ever since I reached discretion,<br>
I have accepted no other<br>
more beloved than you <span class='add'>to me</span>.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw668'></a> “Come here! Having embraced you, \[just<br>
one more\] circumambulation.<br>
And after now there will not be<br>
intercourse between you and me.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw669'></a> The man is not the one who’s wise<br>
in every single circumstance;<br>
paying attention, here and there,<br>
the woman is the one who’s wise. <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw670'></a> The man is not the one who’s wise<br>
in every single circumstance;<br>
quick-thinking, <span class='add'>with good</span> strategy,<br>
the woman is the one who’s wise. <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw671'></a> Quickly indeed, in just a flash,<br>
I came up with a clever trick:<br>
like a deer by a mighty bow,<br>
Sattuka was slaughtered <span class='add'>by</span> me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw672'></a> Who fails quickly to understand<br>
the circumstances that arise,<br>
he gets murdered, that silly thief,<br>
in the belly of a mountain. <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw673'></a> Who does not fail to quickly grasp<br>
the circumstances that arise,<br>
she is freed from creaturely bonds;<br>
such was I from Sattuka then. <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw674'></a> Then I made him, Sattuka, fall<br>
from a treacherous mountain road.<br>
Coming into the presence of<br>
some white-clad <span class='add'>adepts,</span> I went forth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw675'></a> Then after plucking out my hair<br>
altogether, using tweezers,<br>
being ordained, in no long time,<br>
they detailed their own tradition. <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw676-677'></a> Then after I had learned <span class='add'>all</span> that,<br>
<span class='add'>gone off by</span> myself, sitting down,<br>
I thought about that tradition.<br>
<span class='add'>Then</span> a dog brought a human hand,<br>
chewed off, and after dropping <span class='add'>it</span><br>
in my vicinity, ran off.<br>
Seeing that maggoty hand, I<br>
took it up for meditation. <a class='vjw' id='vjw38-39'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw678'></a>Then producing deep emotion,<br>
I asked my co-religionists.<br>
They said: “the Śākyan <span class='add'>Buddhist</span> monks<br>
know the answer<span class='add'>s</span> <span class='add'>to your questions</span>.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw40'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw679'></a> “I’ll ask that meaning, approaching<br>
the followers of the Buddha.”<br>
Taking me along they <span class='add'>all</span> went<br>
into the Best Buddha’s presence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw41'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw680'></a> He preached <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i> to me: the heaps<br>
in the thought-spheres and elements;<br>
the Leader taught unpleasantness,<br>
impermanence, dis-ease, no-self. <a class='vjw' id='vjw42'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw681-682'></a> After hearing his <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>, I<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> purified the “<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i> eye.”<br>
Learned in the good Teaching, I<br>
asked to go forth and be ordained.<br>
At that time he said <span class='add'>this to me:</span><br>
“Come, lucky one,” <span class='add'>said</span> the Leader.<br>
Then being fully ordained, I<br>
saw a little bit of water. <a class='vjw' id='vjw43-44'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw683'></a> Cleaning <span class='add'>my</span> feet, discerning <span class='add'>that</span><br>
<span class='add'>some water splashed</span> up, <span class='add'>some spilled</span> down,<br>
then at that time I realized,<br>
“all conditioned things are like that.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw45'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw684'></a> Then my heart was liberated,<br>
altogether, without clinging.<br>
Then the Victor dubbed me foremost<br>
of those with quick intuition. <a class='vjw' id='vjw46'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw685'></a> I’ve mastered the superpowers<br>
<span class='add'>like</span> the “divine ear” element.<br>
I know the hearts of others <span class='add'>too,</span><br>
I have done what the Teacher taught. <a class='vjw' id='vjw47'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw686'></a> I remember <span class='add'>my</span> former lives;<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> “divine eye” is purified.<br>
Throwing off all the defilements,<br>
I am purified, <span class='add'>I’m</span> stainless. <a class='vjw' id='vjw48'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw687'></a> The Teacher’s been worshipped by me;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught.<br>
The heavy load has been laid down,<br>
the ties to existence severed. <a class='vjw' id='vjw49'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw688'></a> The reason for which I went forth,<br>
from <span class='add'>my</span> home into homelessness —<br>
I have <span class='add'>now</span> achieved that purpose:<br>
destruction of all the fetters. <a class='vjw' id='vjw50'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw689'></a> In meaning and in the Teaching,<br>
etymology and preaching,<br>
my knowledge is vast and flawless,<br>
through the Great Sage’s majesty. <a class='vjw' id='vjw51'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw690'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw52'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw691'></a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw53'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw692'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw54'></a></p>
