<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw693'></a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
was a Master of Everything.<br>
<span class='add'>That</span> Leader arose in the world<br>
one hundred thousand aeons hence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw694'></a> I then <span class='add'>lived</span> in Haṃsavatī,<br>
born in an undistinguished clan.<br>
Having approached the Best of Men,<br>
I went to him as <span class='add'>my</span> refuge. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw695'></a> And I listened to his <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
containing the Four <span class='add'>Noble</span> Truths,<br>
supremely sweet <span class='add'>like</span> honey, <span class='add'>which</span><br>
brings happiness and mental peace. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw696'></a> One time the Hero, <span class='add'>the Buddha,</span><br>
was placing in that foremost place<br>
a Buddhist nun who wore rough robes;<br>
he praised <span class='add'>her,</span> the Ultimate Man. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw697'></a> Producing not a little joy,<br>
hearing that Buddhist nun’s virtue,<br>
doing service for the Buddha,<br>
according to powers and strengths, <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw698'></a> bowing down to that Hero-Sage,<br>
I aspired to <span class='add'>attain</span> that place.<br>
The Sambuddha approved <span class='add'>of that</span><br>
attainment of that <span class='add'>foremost</span> place, <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw699'></a> “In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw700'></a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
the one named Kisāgotamī<br>
will be the Teacher’s follower.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw701'></a> At that time being overjoyed,<br>
as long as life, heart <span class='add'>full of</span> love,<br>
I attended on the Victor,<br>
the Guide, providing requisites. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw702'></a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw703'></a> In this <span class='add'>present</span> lucky aeon,<br>
Brahma’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,<br>
<span class='add'>the Buddha</span> known as Kassapa<br>
was born, the Best of Debaters. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw704'></a> The attendant of the Great Sage<br>
was the ruler of men back then,<br>
the king of Kāsi, named Kiki,<br>
in Benares, greatest city. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw705'></a> I was his fifth <span class='add'>royal</span> daughter,<br>
well-known by the name of Dhammā.<br>
Hearing the Best Victor’s Teaching,<br>
I chose <span class='add'>to seek</span> ordination. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw706-707'></a> Our father did not permit it;<br>
we <span class='add'>stayed</span> at home during that time,<br>
comfortable royal maidens<br>
doing <span class='add'>our</span> practice with vigor<br>
in virginal celibacy,<br>
for twenty times a thousand years,<br>
fond of waiting on the Buddha,<br>
<span class='add'>the king’s</span> seven joyful daughters. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14-15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw708'></a> Samaṇī, and Samaṇaguttā,<br>
Bhikkhunī, Bhikkhadāyikā,<br>
Dhammā, and also Sudhammā,<br>
and seventh Saṅghadāyikā, <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw709'></a> <span class='add'>now</span> Khemā, Uppalavaṇṇā,<br>
Paṭācārā and Kuṇḍalā,<br>
<span class='add'>the nun</span> Dhammadinnā and I<br>
and Visākhā is the seventh. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw710'></a> Due to those karmas done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw711'></a> And now, in <span class='add'>my</span> final rebirth,<br>
I’m born in a millionaire’s clan,<br>
poor, without wealth, unprosperous,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> married into a rich clan. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw712'></a> Except <span class='add'>my</span> husband, the others<br>
are pointing at me <span class='add'>saying,</span> “Poor!”<br>
But after I became with child,<br>
then I was loved by all of them. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw713'></a> When that lucky young boy <span class='add'>of mine,</span><br>
tender-bodied, comfortable,<br>
as dear to me as <span class='add'>my</span> own breath,<br>
then fell into Yama’s power, <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw714'></a> grief-struck, voicing <span class='add'>my</span> misery,<br>
teary-eyed, <span class='add'>my</span> mouth crying out,<br>
carrying <span class='add'>that young boy’s</span> dead corpse,<br>
I’m going around lamenting. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw715'></a> Then examined by one <span class='add'>doctor,</span><br>
approaching the Best Physician,<br>
I said, “give <span class='add'>me</span> a medicine<br>
to bring <span class='add'>my</span> son back to life, Sir.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw716'></a> The Victor, Skilled in Crafty Speech,<br>
said, “bring <span class='add'>me</span> a white mustard seed,<br>
<span class='add'>collected</span> in whichever home<br>
where <span class='add'>people</span> dying is not known.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw717'></a> Then having gone to Śrāvasti,<br>
not encountering such a house,<br>
where <span class='add'>could I get</span> white mustard seed?<br>
Thereupon I gained mindfulness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw718'></a> Throwing away <span class='add'>my baby’s</span> corpse,<br>
I went up to the World’s Leader.<br>
Having seen me from a distance<br>
the Sweet-Voiced One <span class='add'>then</span> said <span class='add'>to me</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw719'></a> “Better than a hundred years’ life,<br>
not seeing <span class='add'>how things</span> rise <span class='add'>and</span> fall,<br>
is living for a single day,<br>
seeing <span class='add'>things</span> rising <span class='add'>and</span> falling. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw720'></a> Not the condition of the village, or the town,<br>
and also not the condition of one clan.<br>
This is the condition of the entire world<br>
with its gods: the impermanence of <span class='add'>all</span> that is.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw721'></a> Upon hearing those <span class='add'>two</span> verses,<br>
I purified <span class='add'>my</span> “<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i> eye,”<br>
then learned in the great Teaching,<br>
I went forth into homelessness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw722'></a> Then being one who had gone forth,<br>
engaged in the dispensation,<br>
after not a very long time,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship. <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw723'></a> I’ve mastered the superpowers<br>
<span class='add'>like</span> the “divine ear” element.<br>
I know the hearts of others <span class='add'>too,</span><br>
I have done what the Teacher taught. <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw724'></a> I remember <span class='add'>my</span> former lives;<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> “divine eye” is purified.<br>
Throwing off all the defilements,<br>
I am purified, <span class='add'>I’m</span> stainless. <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw725'></a> The Teacher’s been worshipped by me;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught.<br>
The heavy load has been laid down,<br>
the ties to existence severed. <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw726'></a> The reason for which I went forth,<br>
from <span class='add'>my</span> home into homelessness —<br>
I have <span class='add'>now</span> achieved that purpose:<br>
destruction of all the fetters. <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw727'></a> In meaning and in the Teaching,<br>
etymology and preaching,<br>
my knowledge is vast and flawless,<br>
through the Great Sage’s majesty. <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw728'></a> I am wearing robes which are rough,<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> <i lang='pli' translate='no'>saṅghāṭi</i> being made of<br>
<span class='add'>a shroud picked up and</span> brought from a<br>
cemetery along the road. <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw729'></a> The Victor, pleased by <span class='add'>my</span> virtue,<br>
the Guide, among the multitudes,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> placed <span class='add'>me</span> in the foremost place<br>
<span class='add'>of</span> those who wear robes which are rough. <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw730'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw38'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw731'></a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw39'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw732'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw40'></a></p>
