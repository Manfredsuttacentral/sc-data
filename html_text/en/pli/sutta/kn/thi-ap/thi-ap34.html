<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1185'></a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
was a Master of Everything.<br>
<span class='add'>That</span> Leader arose in the world<br>
one hundred thousand aeons hence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1186'></a> I was born in Haṃsavatī,<br>
in a clan of ministers then,<br>
rich, prosperous, very wealthy,<br>
glistening with various gems. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1187'></a> Going along with <span class='add'>my</span> father,<br>
surrounded by a multitude,<br>
having heard the Buddha’s Teaching,<br>
I went forth into homelessness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1188'></a> After going forth I gave up<br>
evil karma with the body.<br>
I purified my way of life,<br>
except for poor conduct through speech. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1189'></a> Pleased in the Buddha, Teaching and<br>
Assembly; eager, respectful,<br>
used to hearing the great Teaching;<br>
I’m greedy to see the Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1190'></a> I then heard <span class='add'>of</span> a Buddhist nun,<br>
foremost among those freed by faith.<br>
Aspiring to <span class='add'>attain</span> that place,<br>
I then fulfilled the three trainings.<br>
The Rest for Those Seeking Pity,<br>
the Well-Gone-One, thereupon said <span class='add'>this</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw6,.7a-b'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1191'></a> “He whose faith in the Thus-Gone-One<br>
is well-established, not shaking,<br>
and whose morals are beautiful,<br>
dear to noble people, and praised; <a class='vjw' id='vjw7c-d,.8a-b'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1192'></a> whose insight is upright and whose<br>
pleasure is in the Assembly:<br>
it is said, “he is not wretched;”<br>
his life’s <span class='add'>considered</span> not useless. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8c-d,.9a-b'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1193'></a> Therefore, wise ones, commit <span class='add'>yourselves</span><br>
to faith and to morality,<br>
to <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-insight and pleasure;<br>
pith of Buddha’s dispensation.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw9c-d,.10a-b'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1194'></a> Hearing that, being overjoyed,<br>
I questioned <span class='add'>him about</span> my wish.<br>
Then the Supreme, Measureless One,<br>
the Guide, prophesied <span class='add'>in this way:</span> <a class='vjw' id='vjw10c-d,.11a-b'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1195'></a> “Lovely one, pleased in the Buddha,<br>
you will receive that well-wished <span class='add'>place</span>.<br>
In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11c-d,.12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1196'></a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
she named Sigālaka’s Mother<br>
will be the Teacher’s follower.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1197'></a> Gladdened after having heard that,<br>
with a heart that was <span class='add'>full</span> of love,<br>
as long as life I then served the<br>
Victor, Guide, through <span class='add'>my</span> practices. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1198'></a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1199'></a> And now, in <span class='add'>my</span> final rebirth,<br>
in Giribbaja, best city,<br>
<span class='add'>I was</span> born to rich millionaires,<br>
with a huge quantity of gems. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1200'></a> My son was named Sigālaka,<br>
taking delight on the wrong road,<br>
slipped into the jungle of views,<br>
keen to worship the directions. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1201'></a> Standing on the road, the Buddha,<br>
the Guide, advised him, seeing him<br>
coming toward the city praising<br>
the directions with balls of food. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1202'></a> When he was preaching the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
there were amazing shrieks of joy;<br>
twenty million men <span class='add'>and</span> women<br>
gained insight into the Teaching. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1203'></a> Then having gone <span class='add'>into</span> the crowd,<br>
having heard the Well-Gone-One’s speech,<br>
gaining the fruit of stream-entry,<br>
I went forth into homelessness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1204'></a> After not a very long time,<br>
hankering to see the Buddha,<br>
refining mindfulness <span class='add'>through</span> him,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1205'></a> I’m going every single day<br>
in order to see the Buddha.<br>
I’m dissatisfied looking at<br>
only <span class='add'>his</span> eye-pleasing body, <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1206'></a> produced by all the perfections,<br>
excellent lair of good fortune,<br>
<span class='add'>his</span> body, strewn with all goodness:<br>
dissatisfied, I’m living <span class='add'>there</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1207'></a> The Victor, pleased at that virtue,<br>
placed me in that foremost <span class='add'>place:</span><br>
“The Mother of Sigālaka’s<br>
foremost among those freed by faith.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1208'></a> I’ve mastered the superpowers<br>
<span class='add'>like</span> the “divine ear” element.<br>
I’m also a master, Great Sage,<br>
of the knowledge in others’ hearts. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1209'></a> I remember <span class='add'>my</span> former lives;<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> “divine eye” is purified.<br>
All the defilements are destroyed;<br>
<span class='add'>I</span> will not be reborn again. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1210'></a> In meaning and in the Teaching,<br>
etymology and preaching,<br>
<span class='add'>this</span> knowledge of mine was produced<br>
in your presence, O Great Hero. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1211'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1212'></a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1213'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>

<p>Thus indeed the bhikkhunī Sigālaka-mātā spoke these verses.</p>
