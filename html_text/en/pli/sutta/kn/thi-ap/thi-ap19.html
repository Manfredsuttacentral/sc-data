<h1>19. Uppalavaṇṇā</h1>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw511'></a> The nun <span class='add'>named</span> Uppalavaṇṇā,<br>
master of the superpowers,<br>
having worshipped the Teacher’s feet,<br>
spoke these words <span class='add'>to him at that time:</span> <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw512'></a> “Birth and rebirth crossed beyond,<br>
I’ve attained the unshaking state.<br>
All suffering’s destroyed by me;<br>
I’m declaring <span class='add'>it,</span> O Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw513'></a> Throughout the multitudes who are<br>
pleased in Buddha’s dispensation,<br>
if I’ve wronged <span class='add'>some</span> people may they<br>
forgive <span class='add'>it</span> facing the Victor. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw514'></a> Great Sage, I am declaring that<br>
if there’s <span class='add'>some</span> mistake <span class='add'>I’ve made,</span><br>
transmigrating in existence,<br>
may you forgive that transgression.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw515'></a> “Show <span class='add'>your</span> superpowers to those<br>
who practice my dispensation.<br>
Cut off today the doubts throughout<br>
the multitude, which is fourfold.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw516'></a> “Great Hero, I am your daughter.<br>
O Wise One, O Effulgent One,<br>
I’ve done very difficult deeds,<br>
difficult and numerous <span class='add'>too</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw517'></a> My <span class='add'>skin</span> is blue-lotus-colored;<br>
by name I am named “Blue Lotus.”<br>
I’m your follower, Great Hero,<br>
worshipping your feet, Eyeful One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw518'></a> Rāhula and I myself<br>
due to our similar mindsets,<br>
were born in the same conditions<br>
various hundred many <span class='add'>times</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw519'></a> Rebirth is together <span class='add'>with him</span><br>
and after birth too, together.<br>
<span class='add'>Now</span> in <span class='add'>our</span> final existence<br>
both, <span class='add'>born in</span> varied conditions, <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw520'></a> together: Rāhula’s <span class='add'>your</span> son;<br>
I’m <span class='add'>your</span> daughter, named “Blue Lotus.”<br>
See my superpowers, Hero;<br>
I’ll show <span class='add'>my</span> strength to the Teacher.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw521'></a> She put the four great oceans down<br>
into the palm of <span class='add'>her own</span> hand,<br>
just like a youthful physician<br>
does oil destined for the bladder. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw522'></a> Tearing up earth, she put <span class='add'>it</span> down<br>
into the palm of <span class='add'>her own</span> hand,<br>
like a tender young boy picking<br>
a <span class='add'>flower that’s</span> full of color. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw523'></a> Her palm, <span class='add'>big</span> as the universe,<br>
covering <span class='add'>the world</span> from the top,<br>
caused raindrops of various hues<br>
to rain forth again and again. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw524'></a> Making earth into <span class='add'>a</span> mortar,<br>
making Mount Meru <span class='add'>her</span> pestle,<br>
as though a youthful grinding girl,<br>
grinding grain <span class='add'>flour</span>, <span class='add'>she made</span> gravel. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw525'></a> “I am the Best Buddha’s daughter;<br>
by name I am named “Blue Lotus.”<br>
A master of superpowers,<br>
I practice your dispensation.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw526'></a> Making varied transformations,<br>
showing them to the World’s Leader,<br>
announcing name and lineage,<br>
I worship <span class='add'>your</span> feet, Eyeful One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw527'></a> I’ve mastered the superpower<br>
<span class='add'>called</span> the “divine ear” element.<br>
I’m also a master, Great Sage,<br>
of the knowledge in others’ hearts. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw528'></a> I remember <span class='add'>my</span> former lives;<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> “divine eye” is purified.<br>
All the defilements are destroyed;<br>
<span class='add'>I</span> will not be reborn again. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw529'></a> In meaning and in the Teaching,<br>
etymology and preaching,<br>
my knowledge is vast and flawless,<br>
through the Great Sage’s majesty. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw530'></a> In the presence and the absence<br>
of the Chief Victors, formerly,<br>
much service was performed by me<br>
for the sake of you, O Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw531'></a> What good karma was done by me,<br>
formerly in existence, Sage;<br>
<span class='add'>that</span> merit heaped up by me was<br>
for the sake of you, Great Hero. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw532'></a> Avoiding wrong behavior <span class='add'>and</span><br>
the <span class='add'>nine</span> impossible places;<br>
the ultimate life’s my duty<br>
for the sake of you, Great Hero. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw533'></a> I donated from my <span class='add'>own funds</span><br>
ten thousand ten millions <span class='add'>in gold</span>;<br>
my <span class='add'>very</span> life was abandoned<br>
for the sake of you, Great Hero.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw534'></a> Then all of them, greatly composed,<br>
hands pressed together on <span class='add'>their</span> heads,<br>
said, “Sister, how’d you make the effort<br>
for such unmatched superpower?”</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw535'></a>One hundred thousand aeons hence<br>
I was a cobra<span class='add'>-god</span> maiden,<br>
known by the name of Vimala,<br>
well-honored among the maidens. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw536'></a> The great cobra Mahoraga,<br>
pleased in Buddha’s dispensation,<br>
invited Padumuttara<br>
of Great Power, with followers. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw537-538'></a> Sounding musical instruments,<br>
going out to meet the Sambuddha,<br>
he made the Buddha’s road ready —<br>
a pavilion made out of gems,<br>
a palanquin made out of gems,<br>
things to enjoy made out of gems,<br>
strewn with sand that was <span class='add'>mixed with</span> gems,<br>
adorned with flags <span class='add'>covered in</span> gems. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26-27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw539'></a> The World’s Leader, surrounded by<br>
the multitude, which is fourfold,<br>
sat down on an excellent seat<br>
there in Mahoraga’s palace. <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw540'></a> The cobra-king, greatly famed one,<br>
gave excellent and excellent<br>
food and drink, hard food <span class='add'>that’s filling,</span><br>
soft food <span class='add'>to drink,</span> very costly. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw541'></a> Having eaten, having rinsed the<br>
bowl completely, the Sambuddha<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> made <span class='add'>an expression of</span> thanks<br>
to <span class='add'>us,</span> the cobra<span class='add'>-god</span> maidens. <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw542-543'></a> Discerning <span class='add'>what was in</span> my heart<br>
and <span class='add'>my</span> mind which was fixed <span class='add'>on him,</span><br>
<span class='add'>taking</span> pleasure in the Teacher,<br>
<span class='add'>when</span> the cobra maidens had seen<br>
the one whose name was Best Lotus,<br>
Greatly Famed All-Knower in bloom,<br>
<span class='add'>that</span> Great Hero, at that moment,<br>
showed a nun with superpowers. <a class='vjw' id='vjw31-32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw544'></a> That Buddhist nun, very skillful,<br>
displayed diverse superpowers.<br>
Thrilling with delight, <span class='add'>and</span> awe-struck,<br>
I said this to <span class='add'>him,</span> the Teacher: <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw545'></a> “I <span class='add'>too</span> saw the superpower<br>
of this happy <span class='add'>Buddhist nun</span>.<br>
Just how, Hero, did she become<br>
so skillful in superpowers?” <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw546'></a> “<span class='add'>This nun</span> with great powers is my<br>
legitimate daughter, mouth-born;<br>
she’s followed my instructions, thus<br>
she’s so skilled in superpowers.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw547'></a> Hearing the words of the Buddha,<br>
delighted indeed I aspired,<br>
“I too shall become such a one,<br>
so skillful in superpowers. <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw548'></a> I am delighted, I’m happy;<br>
in the not-yet-become future,<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> supreme aspiration reached,<br>
I will be like her, O Leader.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw549'></a> Satisfying with food and drink<br>
the World’s Leader with Assembly,<br>
on a palanquin made of gems,<br>
within a shining pavilion, <a class='vjw' id='vjw38'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw550'></a> I worshipped <span class='add'>him,</span> the World’s Leader,<br>
<span class='add'>that</span> my color should be that of<br>
an <i lang='pli' translate='no'>aruṇa</i> <span class='add'>type</span> blue lotus,<br>
foremost flower of the cobras. <a class='vjw' id='vjw39'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw551'></a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw40'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw552'></a> Fallen from there, being reborn<br>
as a human being, I gave<br>
a Self-Become <span class='add'>Lonely Buddha</span><br>
alms food covered with lotuses. <a class='vjw' id='vjw41'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw553'></a> In the ninety-first aeon hence<br>
the Leader known as Vipassi<br>
arose, the One Good to Look At,<br>
the One with Eyes for Everything. <a class='vjw' id='vjw42'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw554'></a> Being a millionaire’s daughter<br>
in Benares, supreme city,<br>
inviting <span class='add'>him,</span> the Sambuddha,<br>
the World’s Leader with Assembly, <a class='vjw' id='vjw43'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw555'></a> after donating a very<br>
large almsgiving to the Guide, and<br>
worshipping with lotuses, I<br>
wished through them for splendid color. <a class='vjw' id='vjw44'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw556'></a> In this <span class='add'>present</span> lucky aeon<br>
Brahma’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,<br>
<span class='add'>the Buddha</span> known as Kassapa<br>
was born, the Best of Debaters. <a class='vjw' id='vjw45'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw557'></a> The attendant of the Great Sage<br>
was the ruler of men back then,<br>
the king of Kāsi, named Kiki,<br>
in Benares, greatest city. <a class='vjw' id='vjw46'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw558'></a> I was that <span class='add'>king’s</span> second daughter,<br>
who was named Samaṇaguttā.<br>
Hearing the Best Victor’s Teaching,<br>
I chose <span class='add'>to seek</span> ordination. <a class='vjw' id='vjw47'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw559-560'></a> Our father did not permit it;<br>
we <span class='add'>stayed</span> at home during that time,<br>
comfortable royal maidens<br>
doing <span class='add'>our</span> practice with vigor<br>
in virginal celibacy,<br>
for twenty times a thousand years,<br>
fond of waiting on the Buddha,<br>
<span class='add'>the king’s</span> seven joyful daughters. <a class='vjw' id='vjw48-49'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw561'></a> Samaṇī, and Samaṇaguttā,<br>
Bhikkhunī, Bhikkhadāyikā,<br>
Dhammā, and also Sudhammā,<br>
and seventh Saṅghadāyikā, <a class='vjw' id='vjw50'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw562'></a> <span class='add'>now</span> I, and <span class='add'>the nun named</span> Khemā,<br>
Paṭācārā and Kuṇḍalā,<br>
Kisāgotamī, Dhammadinnā,<br>
and Visākhā is the seventh. <a class='vjw' id='vjw51'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw563'></a> Due to those karmas done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw52'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw564'></a> Fallen from there, being reborn<br>
as a human, in a great clan,<br>
I gave an arahant a robe<br>
of costly saffron-colored silk. <a class='vjw' id='vjw53'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw565'></a> Fallen from there, reborn among<br>
brahmins in Ariṭṭhapura,<br>
daughter of Tirīṭavaccha,<br>
I was charming Ummādantī. <a class='vjw' id='vjw54'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw566'></a> Fallen from there, I <span class='add'>was born</span> in<br>
an undistinguished rural clan.<br>
I was then engrossed in guarding<br>
rice in a not-quite-ripened field. <a class='vjw' id='vjw55'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw567'></a> Having seen a Lonely Buddha,<br>
giving <span class='add'>him</span> five hundred grains of<br>
roasted paddy, lotus-covered,<br>
I wished <span class='add'>to have</span> five hundred sons. <a class='vjw' id='vjw56'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw568'></a> With those wishes having given<br>
honey to <span class='add'>that</span> Self-Become One,<br>
fallen from there I was reborn<br>
in a lotus in the forest. <a class='vjw' id='vjw57'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw569'></a> Being the Kāsi king’s chief queen,<br>
I was respected and worshipped.<br>
I bore royal princes <span class='add'>for him,</span><br>
not one fewer than five hundred. <a class='vjw' id='vjw58'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw59'></a> When <span class='add'>my sons</span> had become young men,<br></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw570'></a>while sporting at <span class='add'>their</span> water sports,<br>
<br>
seeing fallen lotus <span class='add'>petals,</span><br>
<br>
they turned into Lonely-Leaders.</p>
<br>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw571'></a> I was then grieved, being bereft<br>
of those heroes who were <span class='add'>my</span> sons.<br>
Fallen <span class='add'>from there</span>, I was born in<br>
a village near Isigili. <a class='vjw' id='vjw60'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw572-573'></a> When <span class='add'>I</span>, Buddha-mother <span class='add'>reborn,</span><br>
then well-guarded myself,<br>
was going carrying rice gruel,<br>
having seen eight Lonely-Leaders<br>
going to the village for alms,<br>
I remembered <span class='add'>my former</span> sons.<br>
Then a stream of milk spurted out<br>
from me out of love for <span class='add'>my</span> sons. <a class='vjw' id='vjw61-62'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw574'></a> And then I gave rice gruel to them,<br>
<span class='add'>feeling</span> well-pleased by <span class='add'>my</span> own hands.<br>
Fallen from there I was reborn<br>
in “Joy” with the thirty<span class='add'>-three gods.</span> <a class='vjw' id='vjw63'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw575'></a> Feeling <span class='add'>both</span> happiness and pain,<br>
transmigrating from birth to birth,<br>
my <span class='add'>very</span> life was abandoned<br>
for the sake of you, Great Hero. <a class='vjw' id='vjw64'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw576-577'></a> Thus suffering in varied forms,<br>
various forms of happiness:<br>
when <span class='add'>my</span> last rebirth was attained,<br>
I’m born in Śrāvasti city,<br>
in a wealthy millionaire’s clan,<br>
comfortable, decorated,<br>
glistening with various gems,<br>
endowed with every sense-pleasure. <a class='vjw' id='vjw65-66'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw578'></a> I was respected and worshipped,<br>
revered, likewise <span class='add'>also</span> esteemed.<br>
I achieved radiant beauty,<br>
much-respected among the clans. <a class='vjw' id='vjw67'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw579'></a> And I was very much desired,<br>
through the good fortune of beauty,<br>
desired by various hundreds<br>
of millionaire’s sons <span class='add'>living there</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw68'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw580'></a> After abandoning <span class='add'>my</span> house,<br>
I went forth into homelessness.<br>
When eight months had not yet elapsed,<br>
I attained the Four <span class='add'>Noble</span> Truths. <a class='vjw' id='vjw69'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw581'></a> “With superpowers creating<br>
a chariot with four horses,<br>
I will worship the feet of the<br>
Buddha, World’s Lord, Resplendent One.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw70'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw582'></a> “O nun, having approached a tree in full bloom,<br>
you remain alone, at <span class='add'>that</span> <i lang='pli' translate='no'>sāla</i> tree’s roots.<br>
You have no second in natural beauty.<br>
Foolish one, aren’t you afraid of wanton men?” <a class='vjw' id='vjw71'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw583'></a> “Even if a hundred thousand wanton men<br>
come to this place, should behave in such a way,<br>
I would not be terrified, not a hair raised:<br>
I’m not afraid of <span class='add'>you,</span> Death, when I’m alone. <a class='vjw' id='vjw72'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw584'></a> I, this <span class='add'>nun</span> am disappearing;<br>
I am hiding in your belly;<br>
you do not see me, standing <span class='add'>here</span><br>
in the <span class='add'>spot</span> between <span class='add'>your</span> eyebrows. <a class='vjw' id='vjw73'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw585'></a> Becoming master of <span class='add'>my</span> mind,<br>
<span class='add'>I</span> developed superpowers;<br>
I’m liberated from all bonds:<br>
I am not afraid of you, friend. <a class='vjw' id='vjw74'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw586'></a> Sense pleasures are swords <span class='add'>and</span> daggers;<br>
the heaps executioner’s blocks.<br>
I now dislike the enjoyment<br>
of sense-pleasures of which you spoke. <a class='vjw' id='vjw75'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw587'></a> Everywhere, enjoyments are slain;<br>
the mass of darkness is destroyed.<br>
Know it like this, O evil one:<br>
you have been killed, O end-maker.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw76'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw588'></a> The Victor, pleased by <span class='add'>my</span> virtue,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> placed me in that foremost place.<br>
To the crowds the Guide <span class='add'>announced</span> me<br>
“best of those with superpowers.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw77'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw589'></a> The Teacher’s been worshipped by me;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught.<br>
The heavy load has been laid down,<br>
the ties to existence severed. <a class='vjw' id='vjw78'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw590'></a> The reason for which I went forth<br>
from <span class='add'>my</span> home into homelessness —<br>
I have <span class='add'>now</span> achieved that purpose:<br>
destruction of all the fetters. <a class='vjw' id='vjw79'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw591'></a> By the moment they’re bringing <span class='add'>me</span><br>
monastic robes and begging bowls,<br>
<span class='add'>all</span> the requisites and lodgings,<br>
<span class='add'>in</span> the thousands from everywhere. <a class='vjw' id='vjw80'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw592'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw81'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw593'></a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw82'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw594'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw83'></a></p>
