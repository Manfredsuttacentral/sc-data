<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1246'></a> Ninety-one aeons ago the<br>
Leader, whose name was Vipassi,<br>
arose, the One Good to Look At,<br>
the One with Eyes for Everything. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1247'></a> I was then in Bandhumatī,<br>
born in a large clan, prosperous<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> rich; beautiful and held dear,<br>
I am worshipped by the people. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1248'></a> Having approached the Great Hero,<br>
Vipassi, Leader of the World,<br>
hearing the Teaching, I went for<br>
refuge <span class='add'>in</span> the Leader of Men. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1249'></a> Having been restrained in morals,<br>
when the Best Man reached nirvana,<br>
I offered a gold umbrella<br>
on top of the relic-stupa. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1250'></a> I’m freely generous, moral<br>
as long as life; fallen from there,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1251'></a> In ten ways I was outshining<br>
<span class='add'>all the</span> other <span class='add'>gods who lived there</span>:<br>
through shapes <span class='add'>and</span> sounds <span class='add'>and</span> fragrances,<br>
through tastes and the <span class='add'>things that I</span> touch, <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1252'></a> in terms of lifespan, complexion,<br>
happiness and famousness too<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> likewise through supreme power<br>
I shone, having attained <span class='add'>those ten</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1253'></a> And now, in <span class='add'>my</span> final rebirth,<br>
I’m born in Kapilavastu.<br>
I’m well-known <span class='add'>by the</span> name Nandā,<br>
the Śākyan Khemaka’s daughter. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1254'></a> The nickname “Very Beautiful”<br>
indicated my loveliness;<br>
when I had attained discretion,<br>
<span class='add'>I’m</span> adorned with gorgeous beauty. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1255'></a> Then there was a very big fight<br>
over me among the Śākyans.<br>
Then <span class='add'>my</span> father had me ordained,<br>
“don’t let the Śākyas be destroyed.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1256'></a> Going forth like that, having heard<br>
that the Supreme Man hates beauty,<br>
I did not approach <span class='add'>the Buddha,</span><br>
bring proud about my beauty. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1257'></a> Not even going for advice,<br>
I’m afraid to see the Buddha.<br>
Then the Victor had me led to<br>
his presence by means of a trick. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1258'></a> Clever in the Path, <span class='add'>the Buddha</span><br>
made three <span class='add'>different</span> women appear<br>
with forms like celestial nymphs:<br>
<span class='add'>one</span> young, <span class='add'>one</span> diseased, <span class='add'>the third</span> dead. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1259'></a> Seeing them, very moved, I was<br>
freed from delighting in bodies.<br>
I stood <span class='add'>there,</span> weary of being,<br>
then the Leader said <span class='add'>this</span> to me: <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1260'></a> “Nandā, see this complex heap as<br>
diseased, disgusting <span class='add'>and</span> putrid.<br>
It is oozing and it’s dripping,<br>
the delight of foolish people. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1261'></a> With one-pointed focus, steadfast,<br>
fix your mind on impurity.<br>
Just as is this, so too is that;<br>
just as is that, so too is this. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1262'></a> Considering that in this way,<br>
industrious by night and day,<br>
you will see with your own wisdom,<br>
having turned away in disgust.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1263'></a> Not delaying in that <span class='add'>purpose,</span><br>
thinking <span class='add'>it all</span> through thoroughly,<br>
I saw this body as it is,<br>
on the inside and the outside. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1264'></a> Then I’m disgusted with bodies,<br>
and inwardly free of passion;<br>
not negligent, no longer yoked,<br>
at peace, and <span class='add'>I’ve reached</span> nirvana. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1265'></a> I’ve mastered the superpowers<br>
<span class='add'>like</span> the “divine ear” element.<br>
I’m also a master, Great Sage,<br>
of the knowledge in others’ hearts. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1266'></a> I remember <span class='add'>my</span> former lives;<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> “divine eye” is purified.<br>
All the defilements are destroyed;<br>
<span class='add'>I</span> will not be reborn again. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1267'></a> In meaning and in the Teaching,<br>
etymology and preaching,<br>
<span class='add'>this</span> knowledge of mine was produced<br>
in your presence, O Great Hero. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1268'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1269'></a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1270'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
