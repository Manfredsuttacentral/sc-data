<p><a class='jw' id='jw166'></a> In the city, Haṃsavatī,<br>
I was a garland-maker then.<br>
My mother and my father too<br>
went off to work <span class='add'>every day then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw167'></a> When the sun was high in the sky,<br>
I saw a <span class='add'>Buddhist</span> monk <span class='add'>just then,</span><br>
who was going along the road,<br>
<span class='add'>so</span> I spread out a seat <span class='add'>for him</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw168'></a> Preparing that seat with woolen<br>
rugs with fleece and decorations,<br>
happy, with pleasure in <span class='add'>my</span> heart,<br>
I <span class='add'>then</span> spoke these words <span class='add'>to that monk</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw169'></a> “The ground is scorched <span class='add'>and</span> boiling hot;<br>
the sun is at its midday high;<br>
the breezes are not blowing <span class='add'>now</span>;<br>
the time is right to come sit down. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw170'></a> This seat <span class='add'>already</span> is prepared<br>
<span class='add'>just</span> for your sake, o sage so great;<br>
having taken pity <span class='add'>on me,</span><br>
<span class='add'>please</span> sit down on this seat of mine.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw171'></a> The monk, well-tamed, with a pure mind,<br>
did sit down there <span class='add'>at my request</span>.<br>
Having taken his begging bowl,<br>
I gave as much as it would hold. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw172'></a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw173'></a> There my well-made divine mansion,<br>
well-fashioned by <span class='add'>giving that</span> seat,<br>
welled up <span class='add'>full</span> sixty leagues in height,<br>
<span class='add'>and was</span> thirty leagues wide <span class='add'>back then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw174'></a> There were diverse couches for me,<br>
made of gold and made of silver,<br>
likewise <span class='add'>some</span> were made of crystal,<br>
and also made out of ruby. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw175'></a> My couch was well-spread with cushions,<br>
covered with embroidered wool rugs<br>
and coverlets of silk with gems,<br>
as well as <span class='add'>some</span> of fur with fringe. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw176'></a> Whenever I desire a trip,<br>
filled with laughter and amusement,<br>
I am going with the best couch,<br>
<span class='add'>in accordance with</span> my wishes. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw177'></a> I was fixed in the chief queen’s place<br>
of eighty kings among the gods.<br>
I was fixed in the chief queen’s place<br>
of seventy wheel-turning kings. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw178'></a> Transmigrating from birth to birth,<br>
I <span class='add'>always</span> obtained great riches.<br>
There was no lack in terms of wealth:<br>
that’s the fruit of <span class='add'>giving</span> one seat. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw179'></a> Transmigrating in two stations,<br>
the human or else the divine,<br>
I did not know another state:<br>
that’s the fruit of <span class='add'>giving</span> one seat. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw180'></a> I am reborn in <span class='add'>just</span> two castes,<br>
kṣatriyan, or else a brahmin.<br>
Everywhere I’m of high family:<br>
that’s the fruit of <span class='add'>giving</span> one seat. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw181'></a> I know no mental turbulence,<br>
<span class='add'>nor</span> is my heart tormented <span class='add'>then</span>.<br>
I <span class='add'>also</span> know no ugliness:<br>
that’s the fruit of <span class='add'>giving</span> one seat. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw182'></a> Wet-nurses are waiting on me,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> many hump-backed servant-women;<br>
I am going from lap to lap:<br>
that’s the fruit of <span class='add'>giving</span> one seat. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw183'></a> Other people bathe and feed me,<br>
and <span class='add'>they</span> fondle me every day.<br>
Others anoint me with perfumes:<br>
that’s the fruit of <span class='add'>giving</span> one seat. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw184'></a> When I dwell in an empty room,<br>
a pavilion, beneath a tree,<br>
discerning what I am thinking,<br>
a couch is <span class='add'>then</span> produced <span class='add'>for me</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw185'></a> Now it is my final lifetime,<br>
turning in my last existence.<br>
Even today, breaking my reign,<br>
I went forth into homelessness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw186'></a> In the hundred thousand aeons<br>
since I gave <span class='add'>him</span> that gift back then,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of <span class='add'>giving</span> one seat. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw187'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw188'></a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw189'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
