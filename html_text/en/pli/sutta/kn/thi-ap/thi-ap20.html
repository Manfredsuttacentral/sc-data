<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw595'></a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
was a Master of Everything.<br>
<span class='add'>That</span> Leader arose in the world<br>
one hundred thousand aeons hence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw596'></a> I was born in Haṃsavatī,<br>
in a clan of millionaires then,<br>
glistening with various gems,<br>
endowed with supreme happiness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw597'></a> Having approached that Great Hero,<br>
I heard <span class='add'>him</span> preaching the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>.<br>
Then, pleasure born <span class='add'>in my heart,</span> I<br>
approached the Victor for refuge. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw598'></a> Then the Victor praised as foremost<br>
of those who follow discipline,<br>
a Buddhist nun, modest, neutral,<br>
careful about what’s allowed and not. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw599'></a> Then, with a heart <span class='add'>full</span> of pleasure,<br>
wishing <span class='add'>I were fixed in</span> that place,<br>
inviting the Ten-Powered One,<br>
the World’s Leader, with Assembly, <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw600'></a> after feeding <span class='add'>them</span> for a week,<br>
giving them the monastic robes,<br>
bowing <span class='add'>my</span> head down at <span class='add'>his</span> feet,<br>
I spoke these words <span class='add'>to that Buddha:</span> <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw601'></a> “If it meets with success, Leader,<br>
I will become just like the one<br>
who was praised by you, O Hero,<br>
on the eighth day before <span class='add'>today</span>.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw602'></a> Then the Teacher said <span class='add'>this</span> to me:<br>
“Lucky one, fear not; breathe with ease.<br>
In the not-yet-become future,<br>
you will attain that wished-for <span class='add'>place</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw603'></a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw604'></a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
the one known as Paṭācārā<br>
will be the Teacher’s follower.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw605'></a> At that time being overjoyed,<br>
as long as life, heart <span class='add'>full of</span> love,<br>
I attended on the Victor,<br>
World’s Leader with <span class='add'>his</span> Assembly. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw606'></a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw607'></a> In this <span class='add'>present</span> lucky aeon<br>
Brahma’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,<br>
<span class='add'>the Buddha</span> known as Kassapa<br>
was born, the Best of Debaters. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw608'></a> The attendant of the Great Sage<br>
was the ruler of men back then,<br>
the king of Kāsi, named Kiki,<br>
in Benares, greatest city. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw609'></a> I was his third <span class='add'>royal</span> daughter,<br>
who was named Samaṇaguttā.<br>
Hearing the Best Victor’s Teaching,<br>
I chose <span class='add'>to seek</span> ordination. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw610-611'></a> Our father did not permit it;<br>
we <span class='add'>stayed</span> at home during that time,<br>
comfortable royal maidens<br>
doing <span class='add'>our</span> practice with vigor<br>
in virginal celibacy,<br>
for twenty times a thousand years,<br>
fond of waiting on the Buddha,<br>
<span class='add'>the king’s</span> seven joyful daughters. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16-17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw612'></a> Samaṇī, and Samaṇaguttā,<br>
Bhikkhunī, Bhikkhadāyikā,<br>
Dhammā, and also Sudhammā,<br>
and seventh Saṅghadāyikā, <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw613'></a> <span class='add'>now</span> I and Uppalavaṇṇā,<br>
Khemā and the nun <span class='add'>named</span> Bhaddā,<br>
Kisāgotamī, Dhammadinnā,<br>
and Visākhā is the seventh. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw614'></a> Due to those karmas done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw615'></a> And now, in <span class='add'>my</span> final rebirth,<br>
I’m born in a millionaire’s clan,<br>
rich, prosperous, very wealthy,<br>
in Śrāvasti, best of cities. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw616'></a> When I’d become a young woman,<br>
overpowered by <span class='add'>my own</span> thoughts,<br>
after seeing a man from the<br>
country, I went <span class='add'>away</span> with him. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw617'></a> I had produced a single son;<br>
the second one was in my womb.<br>
At that time, I had determined,<br>
“I’ll go <span class='add'>see</span> mother <span class='add'>and</span> father.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw618'></a> My husband was not pleased <span class='add'>at that.</span><br>
Then, when he was <span class='add'>on a</span> journey,<br>
<span class='add'>I</span> snuck out of the house alone,<br>
to go to supreme Śrāvasti. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw619'></a> Then my husband came <span class='add'>after me</span>;<br>
he caught up with me on the road.<br>
Then my karma-born labor pains<br>
began, <span class='add'>and they were</span> very cruel. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw620'></a> At the time for me to give birth,<br>
a massive rain-cloud arose <span class='add'>there</span>,<br>
and then <span class='add'>my</span> husband having gone<br>
to find grass, was killed by a snake. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw621'></a> Then miserable <span class='add'>and</span> helpless,<br>
in the throes of painful childbirth,<br>
going toward a relative’s house,<br>
seeing an overflowing stream, <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw622'></a> carrying <span class='add'>my</span> newborn I crossed<br>
to the stream’s other bank, alone.<br>
After nursing <span class='add'>my</span> newborn son,<br>
to help my other <span class='add'>son</span> to cross, <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw623'></a> I turned; an osprey carried off<br>
my wailing babe. <span class='add'>Then</span> the current<br>
swept <span class='add'>him</span> away, <span class='add'>my</span> other <span class='add'>son</span>.<br>
That I was overcome with grief. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw624'></a> Going to Śrāvasti city,<br>
I heard <span class='add'>that</span> my kinsmen were dead.<br>
Full of grief I said at that time,<br>
extremely overcome with grief, <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw625'></a> “Both of my sons have passed away,<br>
my husband is dead on the road;<br>
mother and father and brothers<br>
are burning on a single pyre.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw626'></a> Then <span class='add'>I grew</span> pale and thin, helpless;<br>
<span class='add'>I was</span> in a low state of mind.<br>
After that, while roaming I saw<br>
<span class='add'>him,</span> the Charioteer of Men. <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw627'></a> Then the Teacher said <span class='add'>this</span> to me:<br>
“Do not grieve, child; breathe easily.<br>
You should search after your <span class='add'>own</span> self;<br>
why uselessly torment yourself? <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw628'></a> There are no sons to <span class='add'>give</span> shelter,<br>
not fathers nor even kinsmen.<br>
There is no shelter with kinsmen<br>
when one’s seized by the end-maker.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw629'></a> After hearing the Sage’s speech,<br>
I realized the first <span class='add'>path</span> fruit.<br>
Having gone forth, in no long time,<br>
I achieved <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship. <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw630'></a> I’ve mastered the superpowers<br>
<span class='add'>like</span> the “divine ear” element.<br>
I know the hearts of others <span class='add'>too,</span><br>
I have done what the Teacher taught. <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw631'></a> I remember <span class='add'>my</span> former lives;<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> “divine eye” is purified.<br>
Throwing off all the defilements,<br>
I am purified, <span class='add'>I’m</span> stainless. <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw632'></a> Then I learned the whole discipline,<br>
in the All-Seeing-One’s presence,<br>
and I recited it <span class='add'>for him,</span><br>
correctly in every detail. <a class='vjw' id='vjw38'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw633'></a> The Victor, pleased by <span class='add'>my</span> virtue,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> placed me in that foremost place:<br>
“Paṭācārā’s alone, foremost<br>
of those who follow discipline.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw39'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw634'></a> The Teacher’s been worshipped by me;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught.<br>
The heavy load has been laid down,<br>
the ties to existence severed. <a class='vjw' id='vjw40'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw635'></a> The reason for which I went forth,<br>
from <span class='add'>my</span> home into homelessness —<br>
I have <span class='add'>now</span> achieved that purpose:<br>
destruction of all the fetters. <a class='vjw' id='vjw41'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw636'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw42'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw637'></a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw43'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw638'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw44'></a></p>
