<p><a class='jw' id='jw1287-1288'></a> Gone forth in the dispensation<br>
of the Blessed One, Vipassi,<br>
and of Sikhi and Vessabhu,<br>
the Sage Kakusandha <span class='add'>Buddha</span>,<br>
Konāgamana, Neutral One,<br>
and of the Buddha Kassapa,<br>
<span class='add'>I’m</span> a nun endowed with morals,<br>
clever, with senses <span class='add'>well-</span>controlled. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1-2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1289'></a> Learned bearer of the Teaching,<br>
asker of the Teaching’s meaning,<br>
studier of, listener to<br>
and worshipper of the Teaching, <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1290'></a> amidst the people I’m preaching<br>
in the Victor’s dispensation.<br>
Because of <span class='add'>my</span> profound learning,<br>
I despised kind associates. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1291'></a> And now, in <span class='add'>my</span> final rebirth,<br>
I am a water-jug slave-girl,<br>
born in Śrāvasti, best city,<br>
in Anāthapiṇḍi<span class='add'>ka</span>’s house. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1292'></a> Gone <span class='add'>bearing</span> a load of water,<br>
I saw an erudite brahmin,<br>
<span class='add'>standing</span> in the water, chilly.<br>
After seeing him I said this: <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1293'></a> “Bearing water I always go<br>
down to the water in the cold,<br>
scared with fear of the master’s stick,<br>
oppressed by fear of faults called out. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1294'></a> Of what are you afraid, brahmin?<br>
Limbs shivering you always go<br>
down to the water, so much cold<br>
being experienced by you.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1295'></a> “You certainly know, Puṇṇikā.<br>
You are asking me who’s doing<br>
wholesome karma and warding off<br>
karma with evil <span class='add'>consequence</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1296'></a> Whether he is old is young,<br>
one who performs evil karma,<br>
just by sprinkling himself with water,<br>
is freed from <span class='add'>that</span> evil karma.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1297'></a> I spoke a verse of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i> to<br>
<span class='add'>him</span> coming out of the water.<br>
Hearing that <span class='add'>he</span> was very moved;<br>
gone forth, he was an arahant. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1298'></a> When I was born in the slave clan,<br>
<span class='add'>I</span> completed the full hundred.<br>
Therefore they named me “Completer,”<br>
and freed me from <span class='add'>my</span> slavery. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1299'></a> Getting the millionaire’s consent,<br>
I went forth into homelessness.<br>
After not a very long time,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1300'></a> I’ve mastered the superpowers<br>
<span class='add'>like</span> the “divine ear” element.<br>
I’m also a master, Great Sage,<br>
of the knowledge in others’ hearts. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1301'></a> I remember <span class='add'>my</span> former lives;<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> “divine eye” is purified.<br>
All the defilements are destroyed;<br>
<span class='add'>I</span> will not be reborn again. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1302'></a> In meaning and in the Teaching,<br>
etymology and preaching,<br>
<span class='add'>this</span> knowledge of mine was produced<br>
in your presence, O Great Hero. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1303'></a> Through meditation, very wise;<br>
through what has been heard, one’s learned;<br>
but karma will not be destroyed<br>
through the pride of those of high birth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1304'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1305'></a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1306'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>

<p>Thus indeed the bhikkhunī Puṇṇikā spoke these verses.</p>
