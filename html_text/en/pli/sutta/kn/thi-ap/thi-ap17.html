<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw226'></a> One day the <span class='add'>Great</span> Lamp of the World,<br>
the Caravan Leader for men,<br>
dwelt in the Mahāvana Hall,<br>
among Vesali’s gabled roofs. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw227'></a> The Victor’s mother’s sister then,<br>
the Buddhist nun Great Gotamī,<br>
was dwelling in a nuns’ refuge,<br>
built in that delightful city. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw228'></a> This reasoning occurred to her,<br>
thinking <span class='add'>when</span> she’d gone off alone<br>
from liberated Buddhist nuns<br>
numbering five times one hundred: <a class='vjw' id='vjw2e-f,.3a-b'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw229'></a> “I will not be able to see<br>
the Buddha’s final nirvana,<br>
<span class='add'>that</span> of the two chief followers,<br>
nor Rāhul, Ānanda, Nanda. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3c-f'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw230'></a> Destroying life’s constituents<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> letting go, I shall go to<br>
nirvana, permitted by <span class='add'>him,</span><br>
the Great Sage, the Lord of the World.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw231'></a> <span class='add'>That</span> reasoning also occurred<br>
to the five hundred Buddhist nuns;<br>
that reasoning also <span class='add'>occurred</span><br>
to <span class='add'>nuns</span> beginning with Khema. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw232'></a> At that time there was an earthquake;<br>
the thunder of the gods did roar.<br>
Weighed down by grief, the goddesses<br>
who lived in that refuge <span class='add'>for nuns,</span><br>
piteously weeping <span class='add'>at that,</span><br>
shed <span class='add'>their</span> tears there <span class='add'>in the refuge</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw233'></a> <span class='add'>And then</span> all of those Buddhist nuns,<br>
after approaching Gotamī,<br>
placing <span class='add'>their</span> heads upon <span class='add'>her</span> feet,<br>
spoke these words <span class='add'>they addressed to her,</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw234'></a> “Sister, gone off alone, there we<br>
were sprinkled with drops of water.<br>
The unshaking earth is shaking,<br>
the thunder of the gods roaring,<br>
lamentations are being heard:<br>
what then does this mean, Gotamī?” <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw235'></a> She then told everything <span class='add'>to them,</span><br>
just as <span class='add'>she had</span> reasoned it out.<br>
All of them too told <span class='add'>Gotamī,</span><br>
just as <span class='add'>they had</span> reasoned it out. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw236'></a> “If <span class='add'>it’s</span> desired by you, sister —<br>
nirvana, unsurpassed <span class='add'>and</span> pure —<br>
we too will all reach nirvana,<br>
with Buddha’s consent, Pious One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw237'></a> Along with <span class='add'>you</span> we have gone forth<br>
from home and from existence too;<br>
along with <span class='add'>you</span> indeed we’ll go<br>
to nirvana, supreme city.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw238'></a> She said, “what is there to be said<br>
to women who are going out?”<br>
<span class='add'>And</span> then along with all <span class='add'>of them</span><br>
she quitted <span class='add'>that</span> Buddhist nuns’ nest. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw239'></a> “May the goddesses forgive me,<br>
who are dwelling in <span class='add'>this</span> refuge;<br>
this will be my final vision<br>
of <span class='add'>this</span> Buddhist nuns’ residence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw240'></a> I’ll go to unconditionedness,<br>
where <span class='add'>there’s neither</span> death nor decay,<br>
one doesn’t meet the unpleasant,<br>
nor get cut off from pleasant things.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw241'></a> Hearing those words, not passionless,<br>
<span class='add'>those</span> heirs of the Well-Gone <span class='add'>Buddha,</span><br>
overcome with grief lamented:<br>
“Alas, we have little merit. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw242'></a> Without those women this Buddhist<br>
nuns’ nest <span class='add'>now</span> has become empty;<br>
the Victor’s heirs <span class='add'>now</span> are not seen,<br>
as stars <span class='add'>disappear</span> at daybreak. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw243'></a> Gotamī goes to nirvana<br>
along with the five hundred <span class='add'>nuns</span>,<br>
like the Ganges <span class='add'>flows to</span> the sea,<br>
with five hundred tributaries.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw244'></a> The faithful laywomen, having<br>
seen her going along the road,<br>
coming out from <span class='add'>their</span> houses <span class='add'>then</span><br>
bowing down at <span class='add'>her</span> feet said this: <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw245'></a> “Great-fortuned one, be satisfied.<br>
Nirvana’s not proper for you,<br>
abandoning us, destitute” —<br>
distraught like that those women wailed. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw246'></a> In order to dispel their grief,<br>
<span class='add'>Gotamī</span> spoke <span class='add'>this</span> honeyed speech:<br>
“Enough with <span class='add'>your</span> crying, children,<br>
today, which is your time to laugh; <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw247'></a> I have understood suffering,<br>
the cause of suffering’s allayed,<br>
I’ve experienced cessation,<br>
I have cultivated the path. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p>(The First Recitation Portion)</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw248'></a>The Teacher’s been worshipped by me,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught!<br>
The heavy load has been laid down,<br>
the ties to existence removed. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw249'></a> The reason for which I went forth<br>
from <span class='add'>my</span> home into homelessness —<br>
I have <span class='add'>now</span> achieved that purpose:<br>
destruction of all the fetters. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw250'></a> While Buddha and his great Teaching<br>
are still around, nothing lacking —<br>
that’s the time for my nirvana;<br>
do not grieve about me, children. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw251'></a> Koṇḍañña, Ānanda, Nanda,<br>
Rāhula, the Victor remain;<br>
the Assembly’s cheerful and close,<br>
the conceit of rivals is slain. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw252'></a> The Famed One in Okkāka’s clan<br>
is Exalted, the Death-Crusher;<br>
children, isn’t it now the time<br>
<span class='add'>for me</span> to achieve nirvana? <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw253'></a> My wish <span class='add'>I’ve had</span> for very long<br>
is <span class='add'>finally</span> fulfilled today.<br>
This is the time for drums of joy.<br>
What then with <span class='add'>all these</span> tears, children? <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw254'></a> If <span class='add'>you feel</span> compassion for me,<br>
and if you all appreciate<br>
the great Teaching’s stability,<br>
then strong and fervent you should be. <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw255'></a> Beseeched by me, the Sambuddha<br>
gave ordination to women.<br>
Therefore as I have shown myself,<br>
you all should follow after him.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw256'></a> Having thus advised <span class='add'>those women,</span><br>
placed in front by the Buddhist nuns,<br>
going up to <span class='add'>and</span> worshipping<br>
the Buddha, <span class='add'>she</span> said this <span class='add'>to him:</span> <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw257'></a> “Well-Gone-One, I am your mother,<br>
and you are my father, Hero;<br>
Lord, who Gives the Good Teaching’s Joy,<br>
O Gotama, I’m born from you. <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw258'></a> Your body, made of flesh and bones,<br>
was reared up by me, Well-Gone-One;<br>
my flawless body, made of Truth,<br>
was reared up by you, <span class='add'>Gotama.</span> <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw259'></a> I suckled you with mother’s milk<br>
which quenches thirst for a moment.<br>
From you I drank the milk of Truth,<br>
peaceful without interruption. <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw260'></a> Great Sage, you owe no debt to me<br>
for protecting and rearing <span class='add'>you</span>.<br>
To obtain such a son is what<br>
women desiring sons <span class='add'>desire</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw261'></a> Mothers of kings, like Mandhātā,<br>
are sunk into existence sea.<br>
O son, through you I’ve crossed over<br>
<span class='add'>life,</span> this ocean of becoming. <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw262'></a> Women can easily obtain<br>
the name “King’s Mother” or “Chief Queen.”<br>
The name, “Mother of the Buddha”<br>
is the hardest <span class='add'>name</span> to obtain. <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw263'></a> O Hero, I’ve obtained that name!<br>
<span class='add'>I got</span> my wish because of you.<br>
Whether little things or big things,<br>
all of that is fulfilled by me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw264'></a> Having abandoned this body,<br>
I want to <span class='add'>reach</span> full nirvana.<br>
Give me permission, O Hero,<br>
O Dis-ease-Ender, O Leader. <a class='vjw' id='vjw38'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw265'></a> Stretch forth your feet, like lilies soft,<br>
which are marked with wheel, goad and flag.<br>
I shall make obeisance to you,<br>
with a <span class='add'>mother’s</span> love for <span class='add'>her</span> son. <a class='vjw' id='vjw39'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw266'></a> Show <span class='add'>me your</span> physical body;<br>
it resembles a heap of gold.<br>
<span class='add'>One last</span> good look at your body,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> off I go to peace, Leader.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw40'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw267'></a> Marked with the thirty-two great marks,<br>
it was adorned in radiance:<br>
the Victor showed her <span class='add'>his</span> body,<br>
a pale sun through an evening cloud. <a class='vjw' id='vjw41'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw268'></a> Then she laid <span class='add'>her</span> head down upon<br>
the soles of <span class='add'>his</span> feet, marked with wheels,<br>
which were like lotuses in bloom,<br>
<span class='add'>as</span> brilliant as the dawning sun. <a class='vjw' id='vjw42'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw269'></a> “I’m bowing to the Sun for Men,<br>
the Banner of the Solar Clan;<br>
when I have died for the last time,<br>
I will never see you again. <a class='vjw' id='vjw43'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw270'></a> Chief of the World, it is believed<br>
that women make every error.<br>
If there’s any error in me,<br>
forgive it, Mine of Compassion. <a class='vjw' id='vjw44'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw271'></a> I begged <span class='add'>you,</span> over and again,<br>
for ordination of women.<br>
If I was in error in that,<br>
forgive it, O Bull Among Men. <a class='vjw' id='vjw45'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw272'></a> O Hero, with your permission,<br>
I instructed the Buddhist nuns.<br>
If <span class='add'>I gave</span> bad advice in that,<br>
forgive it, Lord of Forgiveness.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw46'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw273'></a> “What’s not forgiven to forgive<br>
in <span class='add'>one who’s</span> adorned with virtue?<br>
What more am I to say to you<br>
when you’re going to nirvana? <a class='vjw' id='vjw47'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw274'></a> Those who are desiring escape from the world<br>
in my pure <span class='add'>and</span> complete Assembly of monks,<br>
are like the fading crescent moon at daybreak<br>
after having seen the ruin of its grasps.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw48'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw275'></a> Like the stars and the moon around Mount Meru,<br>
the other nuns circumambulated <span class='add'>him,</span><br>
Chief Victor, <span class='add'>and</span> after bowing at <span class='add'>his</span> feet,<br>
they stood there gazing at the <span class='add'>Blessed One’s</span> face. <a class='vjw' id='vjw49'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw276'></a> “Formerly <span class='add'>my</span> eyes and ears weren’t satisfied<br>
by the vision of you nor hearing your speech.<br>
<span class='add'>But now,</span> having obtained perfection, my mind<br>
is satisfied by the taste of the Teaching. <a class='vjw' id='vjw50'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw277'></a> When you roar forth amidst the crowd,<br>
destroying the sophists’ conceit,<br>
those <span class='add'>there</span> who are seeing your face,<br>
are fortunate, O Bull of Men. <a class='vjw' id='vjw51'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw278'></a> Battle-Ender, fortunate too,<br>
are they who worship your fine feet,<br>
which have broad heels, extended toes,<br>
and nails <span class='add'>the color of</span> copper. <a class='vjw' id='vjw52'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw279'></a> Fortunate too, O Best of Men,<br>
are those who listen to your words,<br>
imperfection-slaying, friendly,<br>
honey<span class='add'>-sweet</span> and full of gladness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw53'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw280'></a> Fortunate am I, Great Hero,<br>
intent on worshipping your feet.<br>
The existential desert crossed,<br>
<span class='add'>I</span> shine due to the good Teaching.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw54'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw281'></a> Then the pious one explained \[her<br>
thoughts\] to the Assembly of monks,<br>
and having worshipped Rāhula,<br>
Ānanda <span class='add'>and</span> Nanda, she said: <a class='vjw' id='vjw55'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw282-283'></a>“I am weary of <span class='add'>my</span> body,<br>
similar to a serpent’s den,<br>
a sickness-house, heap of dis-ease,<br>
pasturing in old age and death,<br>
covered with varied flaws and drool,<br>
dependent on others, actionless.<br>
Therefore I desire nirvana;<br>
give <span class='add'>me your</span> permission, children.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw56-57'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw284'></a> Nanda and lucky Rāhula,<br>
who were griefless, without constraint,<br>
wise <span class='add'>and</span> unshakingly steadfast,<br>
reflected on the way things are: <a class='vjw' id='vjw58'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw285'></a> “Woe on greed for conditioned things:<br>
as worthless as banana wood,<br>
same as a deluded mirage,<br>
fleeting and constantly changing. <a class='vjw' id='vjw59'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw286'></a> In flux are all conditioned things,<br>
in so far as the Victor’s aunt,<br>
the one who suckled the Buddha,<br>
Gotamī, goes without a trace.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw60'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw287'></a> Ānanda was then <span class='add'>still</span> training,<br>
fond of the Victor, <span class='add'>but still</span> sad.<br>
<span class='add'>Beseeching her</span> there, shedding tears,<br>
he was wailing piteously: <a class='vjw' id='vjw61'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw288'></a> “Gotamī is going, smiling;<br>
surely then soon the Buddha too<br>
will be going to nirvana,<br>
like a fire whose fuel has run out.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw62'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw289'></a> Gotamī said to Ānanda<br>
who was lamenting in this way:<br>
“O son, keen on serving Buddha,<br>
your wisdom’s deep as is the sea, <a class='vjw' id='vjw63'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw290'></a> <span class='add'>and so</span> you really should not mourn,<br>
when the time for smiling has come!<br>
Son, <span class='add'>through</span> your assistance to me,<br>
I have realized nirvana. <a class='vjw' id='vjw64'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw291'></a> Being requested by you, dear,<br>
<span class='add'>Buddha</span> gave us ordination.<br>
<span class='add'>Therefore</span> do not be distressed, son;<br>
your effort is <span class='add'>now</span> bearing fruit. <a class='vjw' id='vjw65'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw292'></a> That state unseen by the ancients,<br>
and likewise by rival teachers,<br>
is known by <span class='add'>Buddhist</span> young maidens,<br>
when they’re <span class='add'>only</span> seven years old. <a class='vjw' id='vjw66'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw293'></a> <span class='add'>So take</span> your final look <span class='add'>at me,</span><br>
preserver of the Buddha’s word;<br>
Son, I am going to that place<br>
where one who’s gone cannot be seen.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw67'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw294'></a> Once when he was preaching <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
the Chief Leader of the World sneezed.<br>
At that time, compassionately,<br>
I spoke well-wishing words <span class='add'>to him:</span> <a class='vjw' id='vjw68'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw295'></a> “Live for a long time, Great Hero!<br>
Remain for an aeon, Great Sage!<br>
For the sake of the entire world,<br>
do not grow old <span class='add'>nor</span> pass away!” <a class='vjw' id='vjw69'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw296'></a> The Buddha then said this to me<br>
who had spoken to him like that:<br>
“Buddhas are not to be worshipped,<br>
as you’re worshipping, Gotamī.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw70'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw297'></a> “How then, O One with Omniscience,<br>
should the Thus-Gone-Ones be worshipped?<br>
How should Buddhas not be worshipped?<br>
Being asked, tell <span class='add'>all</span> that to me.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw71'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw298'></a> “See <span class='add'>my</span> followers, united,<br>
vigorously energetic,<br>
constantly firm <span class='add'>in their</span> effort —<br>
that is worship of the Buddhas.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw72'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw299'></a> Then, going <span class='add'>back</span> to the refuge,<br>
<span class='add'>gone off</span> alone, I reflected:<br>
“the Lord, who Reached the Three Worlds’ Ends,<br>
likes a united retinue. <a class='vjw' id='vjw73'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw300'></a> Well then, I’ll reach full nirvana;<br>
let me see no hindrance to that!”<br>
I, contemplating in that way,<br>
after seeing the Seventh Sage, <a class='vjw' id='vjw74'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw301'></a> announced to <span class='add'>the Buddha,</span> the Guide,<br>
the time of my full nirvana.<br>
And then he gave <span class='add'>me</span> his assent:<br>
“you know the time, O Gotamī.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw75'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw302'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw76'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw303'></a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw77'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw304'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw78'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw305'></a> “There are fools who doubt that women<br>
<span class='add'>too</span> gain <i lang='pli' translate='no'>dhamma</i>-penetration.<br>
To dispel that <span class='add'>wrong</span> view of theirs,<br>
display miracles, Gotamī.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw79'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw306'></a> Then bowing to the Sambuddha,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> rising up into the sky,<br>
with Buddha’s assent, Gotamī<br>
displayed various miracles. <a class='vjw' id='vjw80'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw307'></a> Being alone, <span class='add'>then</span> she was cloned;<br>
and being cloned, again alone.<br>
Appearing <span class='add'>then</span> disappearing,<br>
she walked through walls, walked through the sky. <a class='vjw' id='vjw81'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw308'></a> She traveled unattached to earth;<br>
she also sank down into it.<br>
She walked on water as on land,<br>
leaving its surface unbroken. <a class='vjw' id='vjw82'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw309'></a> Cross-legged, she flew like a bird,<br>
across the surface of the sky.<br>
With her body she took control<br>
of space right up to Brahma’s home. <a class='vjw' id='vjw83'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw310'></a> Taking Mount Meru as handle,<br>
she made great earth her umbrella.<br>
Carrying, twirling root and all,<br>
she walked back and forth in the sky. <a class='vjw' id='vjw84'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw311'></a> And like the time when six suns rose,<br>
she caused the entire world to fume.<br>
As though it were the end of time,<br>
she garlanded the earth in flames. <a class='vjw' id='vjw85'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw312'></a> She took mounts Meru, Mandāra,<br>
Daddara, great Muccalinda —<br>
all of them, in a single fist,<br>
like they were <span class='add'>tiny</span> mustard seeds. <a class='vjw' id='vjw86'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw313'></a> She concealed with <span class='add'>her</span> fingertip<br>
the makers of both day and night,<br>
as though a thousand suns and moons<br>
were a necklace she was wearing. <a class='vjw' id='vjw87'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw314'></a> In a single hand she held the<br>
waters of the four great oceans;<br>
she rained forth a torrential rain,<br>
like an apocalyptic cloud. <a class='vjw' id='vjw88'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw315'></a> She made appear up in the sky<br>
a wheel-turner with retinue.<br>
She showed <span class='add'>Vishnu as the</span> boar and<br>
roaring lion, and Garuḍa. <a class='vjw' id='vjw89'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw316'></a> Being alone, she conjured up<br>
a boundless group of Buddhist nuns.<br>
Making them disappear again,<br>
alone, she said <span class='add'>this</span> to the Sage: <a class='vjw' id='vjw90'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw317'></a> “Your mother’s sister, Great Hero,<br>
is one who’s done what you have taught.<br>
An attainer of <span class='add'>her</span> own goal,<br>
she worships your feet, Eyeful One.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw91'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw318'></a> Having shown varied miracles,<br>
descending from up in the sky,<br>
worshipping the Lamp of the World,<br>
she sat down <span class='add'>there, off</span> to one side. <a class='vjw' id='vjw92'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw319'></a> “O Great Sage, I’m an <span class='add'>old woman,</span><br>
a hundred twenty years from birth.<br>
That much is enough, O Hero;<br>
I’m reaching nirvana, Leader.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw93'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw320'></a> Astonished, all the multitudes,<br>
with <span class='add'>their</span> hands pressed together then,<br>
said, “sister, <span class='add'>you</span> have <span class='add'>great</span> prowess<br>
at supernormal miracles.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw94'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw321'></a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
the One with Eyes for everything,<br>
the Leader <span class='add'>of the World,</span> arose<br>
a hundred thousand aeons hence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw95'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw322'></a> I was born in Haṃsavatī,<br>
in a clan of ministers then,<br>
furnished with all <span class='add'>kinds of</span> servants,<br>
rich, prosperous, very wealthy. <a class='vjw' id='vjw96'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw323'></a> Once, when tagging on with father —<br>
attended by a group of slaves —<br>
along with a large retinue,<br>
<span class='add'>I</span> approached that Bull Among Men. <a class='vjw' id='vjw97'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw324'></a> The Victor, like autumnal son,<br>
surrounded by garlands of rays,<br>
without constraints, that <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-cloud<br>
rained forth like the king of the gods. <a class='vjw' id='vjw98'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw325'></a> Seeing <span class='add'>him</span>, being pleased at heart,<br>
and having heard his lovely voice,<br>
the Leader of Men placed his aunt<br>
in the foremost <span class='add'>place among</span> nuns. <a class='vjw' id='vjw99'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw326'></a> Hearing <span class='add'>this,</span> for an entire day,<br>
I gave the Neutral One large gifts<br>
and lots of the requisites to<br>
the Chief of Men with Assembly. <a class='vjw' id='vjw100'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw327'></a> Having fallen down at <span class='add'>his</span> feet,<br>
I aspired <span class='add'>to attain</span> that place.<br>
And then the Greatly Mindful One,<br>
the Seventh Sage, said <span class='add'>to the crowd:</span> <a class='vjw' id='vjw101'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw328'></a> “This one who for a week has fed<br>
the World’s Leader with Assembly,<br>
I shall relate details of her:<br>
<span class='add'>all of</span> you listen to my words: <a class='vjw' id='vjw102'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw329'></a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw103'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw330'></a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
the one whose name is Gotamī<br>
will be the Teacher’s follower. <a class='vjw' id='vjw104'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw331'></a> She will be his mother’s sister,\<br>
the Buddha’s wet-nurse his <span class='add'>whole</span> life.<br>
She will attain the foremost place<br>
among the senior Buddhist nuns.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw105'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw332'></a> Hearing that I was overjoyed,<br>
and then as long as life, I served<br>
the Victor with the requisites.<br>
After that, <span class='add'>having</span> passed away, <a class='vjw' id='vjw106'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw333'></a> born among the Tāvatiṃsa<br>
gods with all delights and riches,<br>
in ten ways I was outshining<br>
<span class='add'>all the</span> other <span class='add'>gods who lived there</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw107'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw334'></a> through shapes <span class='add'>and</span> sounds <span class='add'>and</span> fragrances,<br>
through tastes and the <span class='add'>things that I</span> touch,<br>
in terms of lifespan, complexion,<br>
happiness and famousness too <a class='vjw' id='vjw108'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw335'></a> <span class='add'>and</span> likewise through supreme power<br>
I shone, having attained <span class='add'>those ten</span>.<br>
There I became the beloved<br>
chief queen of the king of the gods. <a class='vjw' id='vjw109'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw336'></a> Transmigrating in the cycle,<br>
being blown on by karma-wind,<br>
I was born in a slave-village,<br>
in the realm of the Kāsi king. <a class='vjw' id='vjw110'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw337'></a> Every day there were five hundred<br>
slaves dwelling in that very place.<br>
I was the wife of he who was<br>
best of all <span class='add'>the slaves living</span> there. <a class='vjw' id='vjw111'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw338'></a> Five hundred self-become <span class='add'>Buddhas</span><br>
entered our village seeking alms.<br>
Along with all <span class='add'>my</span> female kin,<br>
I was thrilled after seeing them. <a class='vjw' id='vjw112'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw339'></a> All of us having formed a guild,<br>
we served those <span class='add'>Buddhas</span> for four months.\<br>
Having given <span class='add'>each</span> the three robes,<br>
we transmigrated with husbands. <a class='vjw' id='vjw113'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw340'></a> Fallen from there with our husbands,<br>
we all went to Tāvatiṃsa.<br>
And now, in <span class='add'>my</span> final rebirth,<br>
born in Devadaha city, <a class='vjw' id='vjw114'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw341'></a> my father, Añjana Śākya,<br>
my mother was Sulakhanā.<br>
We left for Suddhodana’s house,<br>
in Kapilavastu <span class='add'>City</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw115'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw342'></a> The other women born Śākyan<br>
<span class='add'>also</span> came to the Śākyans’ house.<br>
Distinguished among all of them,<br>
I was wet-nurse of the Victor. <a class='vjw' id='vjw116'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw343'></a> After having gone forth, my son<br>
became the Buddha, the <span class='add'>World’s</span> Guide.<br>
Afterwards I renounced the world,<br>
together with the five hundred. <a class='vjw' id='vjw117'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw344'></a> Along with the Śākyan heroes,<br>
I witnessed the comfort of peace.<br>
They were <span class='add'>the men</span> who formerly<br>
had been born as our <span class='add'>own</span> husbands. <a class='vjw' id='vjw118'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw345'></a> Makers of merit together,<br>
they’ve <span class='add'>now</span> seized the crucial moment.<br>
Pitied by the Well-Gone-One, they<br>
experienced arahantship. <a class='vjw' id='vjw119'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw346'></a> The rest of the Buddhist nuns <span class='add'>there</span><br>
<span class='add'>then all</span> rose up into the air.<br>
Come together like <span class='add'>bright</span> stars<br>
those women with great powers shined. <a class='vjw' id='vjw120'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw347'></a> They displayed <span class='add'>their</span> diverse powers<br>
like <span class='add'>different</span> types of ornaments<br>
<span class='add'>might be displayed</span> by a goldsmith,<br>
who is well-trained in workmanship. <a class='vjw' id='vjw121'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw348-349'></a> After displaying miracles,<br>
variegated and many,<br>
having pleased the Fine Debater,<br>
the Sage, and his retinue then,<br>
having descended from the sky,<br>
having worshipped the Seventh Sage,<br>
permitted by the Chief of Men,<br>
they sat down in that place <span class='add'>again</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw122-123'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw350'></a> “Hey, Hero, it was Gotamī<br>
who showed pity to all of us.<br>
Perfumed by your good karma, <span class='add'>we</span><br>
reached destruction of our constraints. <a class='vjw' id='vjw124'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw351'></a> Our defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
we are living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw125'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw352'></a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for us.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>We have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw126'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw353'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>We have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw127'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw354'></a> We are masters of miracles,<br>
O Sage So Great, we are masters<br>
of the “divine ear” faculty,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> knowing what’s in others’ hearts. <a class='vjw' id='vjw128'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw355'></a> We know <span class='add'>all of</span> our former lives;<br>
“divine eye” <span class='add'>now</span> is purified.<br>
All the constraints have been destroyed;<br>
there now will be no more rebirth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw129'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw356'></a> It was in your presence, Great Sage,<br>
that our <span class='add'>own</span> knowledge came to be,<br>
knowing meaning and the Teaching,<br>
etymology and preaching. <a class='vjw' id='vjw130'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw357'></a> Leader, you’re surrounded by us,<br>
<span class='add'>Buddhist nuns</span> with hearts full of love;<br>
O Great Sage, give your permission<br>
to <span class='add'>us</span> to all reach nirvana.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw131'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw358'></a> The Victor said, “What <span class='add'>can</span> I say<br>
to women who are telling <span class='add'>me</span>,<br>
‘we are going to reach nirvana’?<br>
Know that now is your time for it.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw132'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw359'></a> At that time <span class='add'>all</span> those Buddhist nuns,<br>
starting with <span class='add'>the nun</span> Gotamī,<br>
worshipping the Victor <span class='add'>then</span> rose<br>
up from <span class='add'>their</span> seats and went <span class='add'>away</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw133'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw360'></a> The World’s Chief Leader, the Wise One,<br>
with a large body of people,<br>
followed <span class='add'>his own</span> maternal aunt<br>
until <span class='add'>she got up to</span> the gate. <a class='vjw' id='vjw134'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw361'></a> Then Gotamī fell <span class='add'>to the ground</span><br>
at the feet of the World’s Kinsman,<br>
and with all of the other <span class='add'>nuns</span><br>
performed a final foot-worship. <a class='vjw' id='vjw135'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw362'></a> “This <span class='add'>will be</span> my final vision<br>
of <span class='add'>you,</span> the Lord of the <span class='add'>Whole</span> World.<br>
Never again will I see your<br>
face, the fountain of ambrosia. <a class='vjw' id='vjw136'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw363'></a> No more homage to your soft feet;<br>
I won’t <span class='add'>ever</span> touch <span class='add'>them</span> again.<br>
O Hero, Chief of the <span class='add'>Whole</span> World,<br>
today I’ll go to nirvana! <a class='vjw' id='vjw137'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw364'></a> What’s your physical form <span class='add'>or</span> face,<br>
with things being such as they are?<br>
All conditioned things are like that,<br>
providing no comfort, trifling. <a class='vjw' id='vjw138'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw365'></a> She, having gone along with them<br>
back to <span class='add'>her</span> own refuge for nuns,<br>
sat in half-lotus position<br>
in her <span class='add'>own</span> superior seat. <a class='vjw' id='vjw139'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw366'></a> At that time the laywomen there,<br>
fond of Buddha’s dispensation,<br>
hearing her proceeding ahead,<br>
those foot-worshippers approached <span class='add'>her,</span> <a class='vjw' id='vjw140'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw367'></a> pounding on <span class='add'>their</span> chests with <span class='add'>their</span> fists,<br>
<span class='add'>loudly</span> howling piteous cries.<br>
Grieving they fell down on the earth<br>
like creepers cut off at the root. <a class='vjw' id='vjw141'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw368'></a> “Refuge-Bestower, Lord, do not<br>
leave us to go to nirvana.<br>
Bowing down <span class='add'>our</span> heads, all of us<br>
are begging <span class='add'>you, O Gotamī</span>.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw142'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw369'></a> One laywoman, faithful and wise,<br>
was striving the most among them.<br>
While gently stroking that one’s head,<br>
<span class='add'>Gotamī</span> spoke these words <span class='add'>to her:</span> <a class='vjw' id='vjw143'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw370'></a> “Enough with <span class='add'>this</span> depression, child,<br>
twisted up in the snares of Death;<br>
impermanent is all that is,<br>
ever-shaking, ending in loss.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw144'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw371'></a> Then having sent them <span class='add'>all</span> away,<br>
she entered the first altered state,<br>
the second and also the third,<br>
and then she attained the fourth one. <a class='vjw' id='vjw145'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw372'></a> In order, moving <span class='add'>higher still:</span><br>
the plane of space-infinity,<br>
the plane in which perception’s pure,<br>
and that where nothingness is seen. <a class='vjw' id='vjw146'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw373'></a> In reverse order, Gotamī<br>
entered <span class='add'>all of</span> those altered states,<br>
<span class='add'>from the last</span> back down to the first,<br>
and then back up to the fourth one. <a class='vjw' id='vjw147'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw374'></a> Rising up, she reached nirvana,<br>
like the flame of a fuel-less lamp.<br>
There was an enormous earthquake;<br>
bolts of lightening fell from the sky. <a class='vjw' id='vjw148'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw375'></a> The thunder was rumbling loudly;<br>
the deities <span class='add'>gathered there</span> wailed.<br>
A flower-shower from the sky<br>
was raining down upon the earth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw149'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw376'></a> Even regal Mount Meru shook,<br>
just like a dancer on the stage;<br>
the <span class='add'>great</span> ocean was greatly grieved,<br>
and he was weeping in distress. <a class='vjw' id='vjw150'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw377'></a> The gods, snake-gods and titans too,<br>
even Brahmā, awed at that time,<br>
<span class='add'>said,</span> “this one has now been dissolved;<br>
in flux indeed is all that is.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw151'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw378'></a> The <span class='add'>other nuns</span> surrounding her,<br>
who practiced the Buddha’s teachings,<br>
they too attained nirvana <span class='add'>then,</span><br>
like the flames of lamps without fuel. <a class='vjw' id='vjw152'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw379'></a> “Alas! Attachments end up cut!<br>
Alas! Conditioned things all change!<br>
Alas! Life ends in destruction.”<br>
In this way <span class='add'>people</span> were wailing. <a class='vjw' id='vjw153'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw380'></a> Then Brahmā and the deities<br>
went up to <span class='add'>him,</span> the Seventh Sage,<br>
doing what is appropriate,<br>
according to worldly custom. <a class='vjw' id='vjw154'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw381'></a> Then the Teacher told Ānanda,<br>
whose knowledge was <span class='add'>deep as</span> the sea,<br>
“Go <span class='add'>now,</span> Ānanda, tell the monks,<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> mother has reached nirvana.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw155'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw382-383'></a> Then Ānanda, who’d lost his joy,<br>
whose eyes were filling up with tears,<br>
announced, while choking on <span class='add'>his</span> words,<br>
“Come together, O Buddhist monks,<br>
who are residing in the North,<br>
<span class='add'>or</span> in the east <span class='add'>or</span> south <span class='add'>or</span> west.<br>
Let them <span class='add'>all</span> listen to my words,<br>
monks who are the Well-Gone-One’s heirs. <a class='vjw' id='vjw156-157'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw384'></a> This Gotamī, who carefully<br>
reared up the body of the Sage,<br>
has gone to peace, <span class='add'>no longer seen,</span><br>
just like stars when the sun rises. <a class='vjw' id='vjw158'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw385'></a> She’s gone home, leaving behind <span class='add'>her</span><br>
designation “Buddha’s Mother,”<br>
where even <span class='add'>he,</span> the Five-Eyed One,<br>
the Leader, cannot see one gone. <a class='vjw' id='vjw159'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw386'></a> Each with faith in the Well-Gone-One,<br>
and each of the Sage’s pupils,<br>
ought <span class='add'>now</span> to come, that Buddha’s son,<br>
to honor the Buddha’s mother.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw160'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw387'></a> Hearing that, the monks came with speed,<br>
even those living far away.<br>
Some <span class='add'>came</span> by Buddha’s majesty,<br>
some were skilled in superpowers. <a class='vjw' id='vjw161'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw388'></a> <span class='add'>Folks there</span> raised a funeral bier<br>
where Gotamī was <span class='add'>now</span> laid out,<br>
in a good, lovely gabled hut,<br>
excellent <span class='add'>and</span> made out of gold. <a class='vjw' id='vjw162'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw389'></a> The four <span class='add'>gods called</span> “World-Protectors”<br>
hoisted <span class='add'>the bier</span> on their shoulders;<br>
other gods starting with Śakra,<br>
gathered inside the gabled hut. <a class='vjw' id='vjw163'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw390'></a> There were five hundred gabled huts,<br>
the color of autumnal suns,<br>
which were built by Vissakamma,<br>
<span class='add'>for</span> all <span class='add'>of those great Buddhist nuns</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw164'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw391'></a> All those <span class='add'>five hundred</span> Buddhist nuns<br>
were laid out on funeral biers,<br>
hoisted up on shoulders of gods,<br>
lined up in the proper order. <a class='vjw' id='vjw165'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw392'></a> A canopy up in the sky<br>
was stretched out over everything.<br>
The sun <span class='add'>and</span> moon <span class='add'>and all</span> the stars<br>
were drawn on it in <span class='add'>liquid</span> gold. <a class='vjw' id='vjw166'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw393'></a> Flags of various types were raised,<br>
a floral covering stretched out;<br>
flowers rose up out of the earth,<br>
like incense rising in the sky. <a class='vjw' id='vjw167'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw394'></a> <span class='add'>Both</span> the sun and the moon were seen,<br>
and <span class='add'>all</span> the stars were twinkling;<br>
and even when it was high noon,<br>
the sun did not burn, like the moon. <a class='vjw' id='vjw168'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw395'></a> Gods made offerings of garlands,<br>
perfumed with divine fragrances<br>
and <span class='add'>honored Gotamī</span> with songs,<br>
with dances and with discourses. <a class='vjw' id='vjw169'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw396'></a> The snake-gods, titans and Brahmās<br>
according to powers and strengths,<br>
made offerings to the laid-out<br>
mother who was in nirvana. <a class='vjw' id='vjw170'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw397'></a> In front were led off all of the<br>
Well-Gone-One’s heirs in nirvana,<br>
Gotamī was led off after,<br>
honored wet-nurse of the Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw171'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw398'></a> With the gods <span class='add'>and</span> people out front,<br>
the snake-gods, titans and Brahmās,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> next, with followers, Buddha,<br>
processed to worship <span class='add'>his</span> mother. <a class='vjw' id='vjw172'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw399'></a> The Buddha’s final nirvana<br>
was not of such a kind as this.<br>
Gotamī’s final nirvana<br>
was extremely miraculous. <a class='vjw' id='vjw173'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw400'></a> The Buddha <span class='add'>and</span> monks won’t be seen<br>
at Buddha’s <span class='add'>final</span> nirvana.<br>
The Buddha is at Gotamī’s;<br>
so’s Sāriputta and so on. <a class='vjw' id='vjw174'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw401'></a> <span class='add'>Then</span> they built the funeral pyres,<br>
made with all <span class='add'>sorts of</span> fragrant <span class='add'>wood</span>,<br>
and sprinkled with perfumed powder.<br>
Those <span class='add'>great nuns</span> were cremated there. <a class='vjw' id='vjw175'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw402'></a> The remaining portions <span class='add'>and</span> bones<br>
were completely consumed by fire.<br>
And at that time Ānanda spoke<br>
this speech, <span class='add'>which was</span> very moving: <a class='vjw' id='vjw176'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw403'></a> “Gotamī’s gone without a trace<br>
and her corpse has been cremated,<br>
intimating that the Buddha’s<br>
nirvana <span class='add'>too</span> will soon occur.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw177'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw404'></a> Ānanda, urged by the Buddha,<br>
<span class='add'>placed</span> Gotamī’s <span class='add'>sacred</span> relics<br>
in her begging bowl at that time,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> presented them to the Lord. <a class='vjw' id='vjw178'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw405-406'></a> Taking them up with <span class='add'>both his</span> hands,<br>
the Seventh Sage, <span class='add'>the Buddha,</span> said:<br>
“Just as the trunk of a standing,<br>
gigantic timber-bearing tree,<br>
impermanent, breaks into bits,<br>
however massive it may be,<br>
so Gotamī, who was a nun,<br>
has reached <span class='add'>her</span> final nirvana. <a class='vjw' id='vjw179-180'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw407'></a> O! it is a marvelous thing!<br>
My mother who’s reached nirvana,<br>
leaving only relics behind<br>
did not grieve <span class='add'>and was not</span> wailing. <a class='vjw' id='vjw181'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw408'></a> Grieving not for others <span class='add'>left,</span><br>
she’s crossed the sea of existence.<br>
She’s cooled, she’s in nirvana.<br>
<span class='add'>her</span> torment <span class='add'>is now</span> avoided. <a class='vjw' id='vjw182'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw409'></a> Know this about her, O <span class='add'>you</span> monks,<br>
she was a very wise woman,<br>
with wisdom which was vast and wide,<br>
distinguished among Buddhist nuns. <a class='vjw' id='vjw183'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw410'></a> She’d mastered the superpower<br>
<span class='add'>called</span> the “divine ear” element.<br>
Gotamī was a master of<br>
the knowledge stored in others’ hearts. <a class='vjw' id='vjw184'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw411'></a> She remembered <span class='add'>her</span> former lives;<br>
<span class='add'>her</span> “divine eye” was purified.<br>
All the defilements were destroyed;<br>
she will not be reborn again. <a class='vjw' id='vjw185'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw412'></a> She had purified <span class='add'>her</span> knowledge<br>
of meaning and of the Teaching,<br>
etymology and preaching:<br>
because of that she did not grieve. <a class='vjw' id='vjw186'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw413'></a> A rod of iron that’s beaten<br>
when it is glowing due to fire<br>
slowly cools off, <span class='add'>leaving no ash:</span><br>
like that it’s not known <span class='add'>where she</span> went. <a class='vjw' id='vjw187'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw414'></a> No rebirth place can be discerned<br>
of the truly liberated,<br>
who cross the flood of lustful bonds,<br>
who’ve reached unshaking happiness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw188'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw415'></a> Therefore be lamps unto yourselves;<br>
graze in <span class='add'>the field of</span> mindfulness.<br>
With wisdom’s seven parts attained,<br>
you all should end <span class='add'>your</span> suffering. <a class='vjw' id='vjw189'></a></p>
