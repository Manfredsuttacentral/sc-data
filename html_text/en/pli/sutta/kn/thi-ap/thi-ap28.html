<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw952'></a> At one time the Leader of Men<br>
was staying in a mountain cave<br>
in the city, Rajagaha,<br>
<span class='add'>which was</span> lovely and prosperous.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw953'></a> This is what was reasoned out <span class='add'>then</span><br>
by the nun <span class='add'>named</span> Yasodharā,<br>
who was dwelling in that city,<br>
inside a lovely convent <span class='add'>there</span>:</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw954'></a> "Nanda, Rahula and Bhadda;<br>
likewise the two chief followers;<br>
Suddhodana Maharaja,<br>
and Gotamī Pajāpatī;</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw955'></a> the great theras of great renown;<br>
and the therīs with great powers:<br>
they've gone to peaceful <span class='add'>nirvana</span>,<br>
traceless like the flame of a lamp.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw956'></a> While the World's Lord still is living,<br>
I’ll travel that peaceful path too.”<br>
And having reasoned <span class='add'>all</span> that out,<br>
she foresaw the end of her life.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw957'></a> Foreseeing that life’s aggregates<br>
would be destroyed that very day,<br>
she set out from her own ashram,<br>
carrying her robe and her bowl.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw958'></a> Honored by one hundred thousand<br>
nuns, <span class='add'>the nun named Yasodharā,</span><br>
greatly powerful, greatly wise,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> went up to the Sambuddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw959'></a> Having worshipped the Sambuddha,<br>
at the wheel-marked <span class='add'>soles of his feet</span>,<br>
sitting off to one side <span class='add'>of him,</span><br>
she spoke these words to the Teacher: <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw960'></a> “I'm seventy-eight years old now,<br>
the last of old age has arrived;<br>
I'm reporting to the Great Sage:<br>
I've attained <span class='add'>sainthood</span> in a cave. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw961'></a> Old age has ripened for me <span class='add'>now</span>;<br>
verily my life's a trifle.<br>
Giving all you up I will go:<br>
my refuge is made in myself. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw962'></a> In the final days of old age,<br>
death breaks <span class='add'>the body into bits</span>;<br>
today at nighttime, Great Hero,<br>
I shall achieve my nirvana. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw963'></a> Where there's no birth, no growing old,<br>
nor sickness and death, O Great Sage,<br>
I'm going to the <span class='add'>great</span> city<br>
<span class='add'>which,</span> unconditioned, has no death. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw964'></a> Throughout <span class='add'>this vast</span> multitude here,<br>
<span class='add'>all these</span> revering the Teacher,<br>
know that <span class='add'>every</span> imperfection<br>
is forgiven face-to-face, Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw965'></a> Transmigrating in existence,<br>
if I have <span class='add'>ever</span> disturbed you,<br>
I’m announcing it, Great Hero;<br>
please forgive my imperfection. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw966'></a> After hearing <span class='add'>that</span> speech of hers,<br>
the Lord of Sages <span class='add'>then</span> said this:<br>
“What better can I say to you,<br>
when you’re going to nirvana?</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw967'></a> Now display <span class='add'>your</span> superpowers,<br>
doer of my dispensation;<br>
let doubt in the dispensation<br>
be cut off for all assemblies.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw968'></a> Having heard the words of the Sage,<br>
the Buddhist nun, Yasodharā,<br>
worshipping the King of Sages,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> spoke this speech to the <span class='add'>Buddha:</span></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw969'></a> "I am Yasodharā, Hero;<br>
in the home I was your chief queen,<br>
born in the clan of the Śākyas,<br>
established among the women. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw970'></a> In your household, O Hero, I<br>
was the leader, the lord of all<br>
of the <span class='add'>women there, who numbered</span><br>
one hundred thousand ninety six. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw971'></a> All of those women, endowed with<br>
the virtues of beauty and grace,<br>
youthful and well-spoken, revere<br>
me, like people <span class='add'>revere</span> the gods. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw972'></a> Leader of a thousand maidens<br>
in the home of the Śākyan Son,<br>
they’re the same in pleasure and pain,<br>
like gods in <span class='add'>the garden named</span> “Joy.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw973'></a> Beyond the essence of desire,<br>
fixed as the essence of beauty,<br>
<span class='add'>they’re</span> unmatched in terms of beauty,<br>
other than <span class='add'>by</span> the World’s Leader.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw974'></a> Speaking <span class='add'>words</span> beginning with these,<br>
having risen into the sky,<br>
Yasodharā displayed diverse<br>
powers, with Buddha’s permission.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw975'></a> Worshipping the Sambuddha, she<br>
showed the Teacher superpowers.<br>
She displayed great superpowers,<br>
diverse, having various forms. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p>Body big as the universe,<br>
she <span class='add'>made</span> the continent up north<br>
her head; eastern, western <span class='add'>her</span> wings;<br>
<span class='add'>and made</span> India her torso; <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw976'></a> tail feathers: the southern ocean;<br>
<span class='add'>other</span> feathers: varied rivers;<br>
<span class='add'>her</span> eyes were the moon and the sun,<br>
<span class='add'>her</span> crest was cosmic Mount Meru. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw977'></a> <span class='add'>In her</span> beak, mountain at world’s end,<br>
<span class='add'>she carried</span> a tree with its roots.<br>
Coming up to <span class='add'>him,</span> fanning <span class='add'>him,</span><br>
she’s worshipping the World’s Leader. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw978'></a> She made herself an elephant,<br>
likewise a horse, mountain, ocean,<br>
the moon and the sun, Mount Meru,<br>
and Śakra, <span class='add'>the king of the gods</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw979'></a> She covered the thousand-fold world<br>
with blooming lotus, <span class='add'>and then said,</span><br>
“I am Yasodharā, Hero;<br>
I worship <span class='add'>your feet</span>, Eyeful One." <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw980'></a> And making Brahma’s form appear,<br>
she preached the doctrine of merit;<br>
"I am Yasodharā, Hero;<br>
I worship your feet, Eyeful One.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw981'></a> I’ve mastered the superpowers<br>
<span class='add'>like</span> the “divine ear” element.<br>
I’m also a master, Great Sage,<br>
of the knowledge in others’ hearts. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw982'></a> I remember <span class='add'>my</span> former lives;<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> “divine eye” is purified.<br>
All the defilements are destroyed;<br>
<span class='add'>I</span> will not be reborn again. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw983'></a> In meaning and in the Teaching,<br>
etymology and preaching,<br>
<span class='add'>this</span> knowledge of mine was produced<br>
in your presence, O Great Hero. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw984'></a> <span class='add'>My</span> meeting with <span class='add'>all</span> the Buddhas,<br>
the World-Lords, was well-seen by you;<br>
my extensive service <span class='add'>to them</span><br>
was for the sake of you, Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw985'></a> O Sage, recall the good karma,<br>
which formerly <span class='add'>was done</span> by me;<br>
<span class='add'>that</span> merit was heaped up by me<br>
for the sake of you, Great Hero. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw986'></a> I kept from misconduct, hindered<br>
the <span class='add'>nine</span> impossible places;<br>
I have sacrificed life <span class='add'>itself</span><br>
for the sake of you, Great Hero. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw987'></a> I gave myself to be a wife,<br>
several tens of billions <span class='add'>of times</span>.<br>
I was not distressed about that,<br>
for the sake of you, O Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw988'></a> I gave myself to do service,<br>
several tens of billions <span class='add'>of times</span>.<br>
I was not distressed about that,<br>
for the sake of you, O Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw989'></a> I gave myself to <span class='add'>provide</span> food,<br>
several tens of billions <span class='add'>of times</span>.<br>
I was not distressed about that,<br>
for the sake of you, O Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw990'></a> I have given you <span class='add'>all my</span> lives,<br>
several tens of billions <span class='add'>of times</span>.<br>
I’ll liberate <span class='add'>myself</span> from fear,<br>
giving up my life <span class='add'>once more</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw991'></a> Great Sage, for your sake I do not<br>
conceal the things of a woman,<br>
numerous clothes of varied types,<br>
ornaments affixed to <span class='add'>my</span> limbs. <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw992'></a> Wealth and grain have been given up,<br>
villages and also small towns,<br>
fields and sons and daughters <span class='add'>as well</span><br>
have been given up, O Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw993'></a> Elephants, horses, also cows,<br>
slaves <span class='add'>as well as</span> servant-women<br>
are given up beyond all count<br>
for the sake of you, O Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw994'></a> Whatever I am told <span class='add'>to give</span><br>
as alms to beggars, I give <span class='add'>that</span>;<br>
I don’t witness any distress<br>
from giving the ultimate gift. <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw995'></a> I have experienced dis-ease<br>
of diverse types, beyond all count,<br>
in <span class='add'>this</span> much-varied existence<br>
for the sake of you, Great Hero. <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw996'></a> Attaining comfort<span class='add'>s,</span> I don’t thrill;<br>
<span class='add'>I do</span>n’t get distressed by troubles.<br>
Everywhere I remain balanced<br>
for the sake of you, O Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw997'></a> After experiencing <span class='add'>both</span><br>
pleasure <span class='add'>and</span> pain along the way,<br>
the Great Sage reached Awakening,<br>
the Teaching for which Buddha strived. <a class='vjw' id='vjw38'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw998'></a> By you <span class='add'>and</span> by me there was much<br>
meeting with the other World-Lords,<br>
<span class='add'>whether you’re</span> the god Brahmā or<br>
Gotama Buddha, World’s Leader. <a class='vjw' id='vjw39'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw999'></a> I performed a lot of service,<br>
for the sake of you, O Great Sage;<br>
while you sought the Buddha's Teaching,<br>
I was <span class='add'>always</span> your attendant. <a class='vjw' id='vjw40'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1000'></a> One hundred thousand aeons <span class='add'>and</span><br>
four incalculable <span class='add'>aeons</span><br>
hence, Dīpaṅkara, Great Hero,<br>
the Leader of the World was born. <a class='vjw' id='vjw41'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1001'></a> <span class='add'>Some</span>place in a nearby country,<br>
inviting <span class='add'>him,</span> the Thus-Gone-One,<br>
happy-minded folks are cleaning<br>
the road <span class='add'>on which</span> he is coming. <a class='vjw' id='vjw42'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1002'></a> At that time there was a brahmin<br>
<span class='add'>known by</span> the name of Sumedha.<br>
He was making the road ready<br>
for the All-Seer who was coming. <a class='vjw' id='vjw43'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1003'></a> At that time I was a maiden,<br>
born in a brahmin <span class='add'>family</span>,<br>
known by the name of Sumittā.<br>
I went up to that gathering. <a class='vjw' id='vjw44'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1004'></a> With eight handfuls of blue lotus<br>
for offering to the Teacher,<br>
in the midst of <span class='add'>all</span> the people<br>
I saw that fierce <span class='add'>ascetic</span> sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw45'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1005'></a> Seeing <span class='add'>him,</span> seated atop bark,<br>
surpassing <span class='add'>and</span> captivating,<br>
then I thought <span class='add'>like this to myself:</span><br>
“<span class='add'>this</span> life of mine is bearing fruit.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw46'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1006'></a> At that time I saw <span class='add'>that</span> sage’s<br>
effort <span class='add'>which was then</span> bearing fruit;<br>
due to previous karma, my<br>
heart was pleased in the Sambuddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw47'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1007'></a> Making <span class='add'>my</span> heart even more pleased,<br>
I said, “O lofty-minded sage,<br>
seeing no other gift <span class='add'>to give,</span><br>
I’m giving flowers to you, sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw48'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1008'></a> There are five handfuls for you, sage;<br>
the <span class='add'>remaining</span> three are for me.<br>
Let there be success through this <span class='add'>gift</span><br>
for your Awakening, O sage.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw49'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1009'></a> The Fourth Recitation Portion<br>
<span class='add'>Then that</span> sage, taking the flowers,<br>
for the sake of Awakening,<br>
worshipped amidst the people the<br>
Famed One, Great Sage who was coming. <a class='vjw' id='vjw50'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1010'></a> The Great Sage <span class='add'>named</span> Dīpaṅkara,<br>
seeing <span class='add'>him</span> amidst the people,<br>
prophesied <span class='add'>future Buddhahood</span><br>
<span class='add'>for that</span> sage with a lofty mind. <a class='vjw' id='vjw51'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1011'></a> The Great Sage <span class='add'>named</span> Dīpāṅkara<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> prophesied that my karma<br>
would for numberless aeons hence<br>
be exalted, that Sage So Great: <a class='vjw' id='vjw52'></a></p>
<p>“She will be a like-minded <span class='add'>wife</span>,<br>
with karma and conduct like <span class='add'>yours</span>;<br>
through this karma she’ll be loving<br>
for the sake of you, O great sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw53'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1012'></a> Nice looking and much beloved,<br>
desirable, speaking sweet words,<br>
she will be a loving woman,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> an heir among <span class='add'>your</span> doctrines. <a class='vjw' id='vjw54'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1013'></a> Just as masters are protecting<br>
the goods that <span class='add'>they</span> accumulate,<br>
so this one likewise will protect<br>
<span class='add'>all</span> of the things that are wholesome. <a class='vjw' id='vjw55'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1014'></a> Compassionate for <span class='add'>future</span> you,<br>
she will fulfill the perfections.<br>
Like a lion <span class='add'>freed</span> from a cage,<br>
she will achieve Awakening.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw56'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1015'></a> Rejoicing about <span class='add'>Buddha’s</span> speech,<br>
I lived behaving in that way<br>
the Buddha prophesied for me<br>
numberless aeons ago. <a class='vjw' id='vjw57'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1016'></a> I brought pleasure to <span class='add'>my</span> mind when<br>
that karma was well done <span class='add'>by me</span>;<br>
I experienced countless wombs,<br>
divine <span class='add'>as well as</span> human <span class='add'>ones</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw58'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1017'></a> Undergoing pleasure <span class='add'>and</span> pain,<br>
among gods <span class='add'>and</span> human beings,<br>
when <span class='add'>my</span> last rebirth was attained,<br>
I was born in the Śākyan clan. <a class='vjw' id='vjw59'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1018'></a> Beautiful and very wealthy,<br>
famous and likewise virtuous;<br>
endowed with every attainment,<br>
I’m much-honored among the clans. <a class='vjw' id='vjw60'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1019'></a> Riches, fame, hospitality,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> indulgence in worldly things –<br>
<span class='add'>they</span> do not agitate <span class='add'>my</span> mind;<br>
I have no fear from anything. <a class='vjw' id='vjw61'></a></p>
<p>I was appointed to attend<br>
on what the Blessed One had said<br>
within the harem of the king<br>
in the kṣatriyan city then. <a class='vjw' id='vjw62'></a></p>
<p><span class='add'>I’m</span> a woman who’s a servant,<br>
and <span class='add'>one</span> who feels pleasure and pain,<br>
a woman who declares the facts,<br>
a woman who’s compassionate. <a class='vjw' id='vjw63'></a></p>
<p>Buddhas <span class='add'>numbering</span> five billion,<br>
and <span class='add'>another</span> nine billion <span class='add'>more</span> —<br>

<p>Countless followers of Buddhas,<br>
free of defilements, <span class='add'>and</span> stainless;<br>
listen to my <span class='add'>words,</span> O great king:<br>
I’m constantly doing service. <a class='vjw' id='vjw79'></a></p>
<p>I always practice the Teaching<br>
of those practiced in the teachings,<br>
at ease practicing the Teaching,<br>
in this world and in the other. <a class='vjw' id='vjw80'></a></p>
<p>Well-practiced, the Teaching-practice;<br>
that practice is not ill-practiced.<br>
<span class='add'>I’m</span> at ease practicing Teaching,<br>
in this world and in the other. <a class='vjw' id='vjw81'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1020'></a> Disgusted with transmigration,<br>
I went forth into homelessness,<br>
surrounded by thousands <span class='add'>of nuns,</span><br>
after renouncing with nothing. <a class='vjw' id='vjw82'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1021'></a> After abandoning <span class='add'>my</span> home,<br>
I went forth into homelessness.<br>
When eight months had not yet elapsed<br>
I attained the Four <span class='add'>Noble</span> Truths. <a class='vjw' id='vjw83'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1022'></a> Like the waves upon the ocean,<br>
<span class='add'>folks</span> are bringing many varied<br>
monastic robes and alms to eat,<br>
requisites <span class='add'>as well as</span> lodgings. <a class='vjw' id='vjw84'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1023'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw85'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1024'></a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw86'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1025'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw87'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1026'></a> Thus many sorts of suffering<br>
and many types of happiness;<br>
the pure life <span class='add'>now</span> has been achieved,<br>
I have obtained all achievements.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1027'></a> The woman who’s giving herself<br>
for the merit of the Great Sage<br>
attains companionship <span class='add'>with him</span>,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> unconditioned nirvana.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1028'></a> The past is thoroughly destroyed,<br>
and the present <span class='add'>and</span> the future;<br>
all of my karma is destroyed:<br>
I worship your feet, Eyeful One.”</p>
