<p><a class='jw' id='jw769'></a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
was a Master of Everything.<br>
<span class='add'>That</span> Leader arose in the world<br>
one hundred thousand aeons hence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw770'></a> For the benefit, happiness<br>
and profit of all beings, the<br>
Best Debater, Thoroughbred Man,<br>
came into <span class='add'>the world</span> with <span class='add'>its</span> gods. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw771'></a> Foremost Fame-Attainer, Victor,<br>
Fortunate, Beautified by Praise,<br>
the Victor for the entire world,<br>
Widely-Known in all directions, <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw772'></a> the Uprooter of Doubt, the One<br>
who Passed Beyond Uncertainty,<br>
he with an Intention-Filled Mind,<br>
attained Supreme Awakening. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw773'></a> Ultimate Man, Progenitor<br>
of the path that had yet to be,<br>
proclaimed <span class='add'>that which was</span> unproclaimed,<br>
produced <span class='add'>that which was</span> unproduced. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw774'></a> Path-Knower, Path-Understander,<br>
Path-Proclaimer, the Bull of Men,<br>
Path-Skilled, the Teacher, <span class='add'>the Buddha,</span><br>
was the Best of Charioteers. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw775'></a> The Great Compassionate Teacher,<br>
the Leader was preaching <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
lifting up <span class='add'>all</span> living beings<br>
sunk in the muck of delusion. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw776'></a> I was born in Haṃsavatī,<br>
rejoicing <span class='add'>all the</span> kṣatriyans;<br>
I was then very beautiful,<br>
set for wealth, held dear, resplendent. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw777'></a> I was the ravishing daughter<br>
of great king Ānanda and thus,<br>
sister by another mother<br>
of him named Padumuttara. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw778'></a> Adorned in all <span class='add'>my</span> ornaments,<br>
along with the royal maidens,<br>
going up to the Great Hero,<br>
I heard <span class='add'>him</span> preaching the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw779'></a> And then, amidst the multitudes,<br>
the Guru of the <span class='add'>Whole</span> World praised<br>
a Buddhist nun with “divine eye,”<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> placed her in that foremost place. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw780'></a> I was happy having heard that;<br>
after giving the Teacher alms,<br>
and worshipping the Sambuddha,<br>
I aspired for the “divine eye.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw781'></a> And then the Teacher said to me:<br>
“Joyful one, that is well wished-for;<br>
you will receive <span class='add'>as you</span> aspire,<br>
fruit of alms for the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-Lamp. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw782'></a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw783'></a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
the one whose name is Sakulā<br>
will be the Teacher’s follower.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw784'></a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw785'></a> In this <span class='add'>present</span> lucky aeon<br>
Brahma’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,<br>
<span class='add'>the Buddha</span> known as Kassapa<br>
was born, the Best of Debaters. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw786'></a> I was a mendicant back then,<br>
proceeding about on my own.<br>
While wandering around for alms,<br>
I received some sesame oil. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw787'></a> Having lit a lamp with that <span class='add'>oil,</span><br>
with a mind that was very clear,<br>
every night I attended on<br>
the shrine of the Best of Bipeds. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw788'></a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw789'></a> In whichever place I’m reborn,<br>
in accordance with that karma,<br>
wherever I am wandering,<br>
when I’m gone there, there are large lamps. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw790'></a> Through <span class='add'>any</span> wall, through <span class='add'>any</span> rock,<br>
going beyond a mountain <span class='add'>top</span>,<br>
I <span class='add'>can</span> see whatever I wish:<br>
that is the fruit of giving lamps. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw791'></a> I am <span class='add'>someone who</span> has pure eyes;<br>
I am blazing forth through <span class='add'>my</span> fame;<br>
I am faithful, wise and mindful:<br>
that is the fruit of giving lamps. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw792'></a> And now, in <span class='add'>my</span> final rebirth,<br>
I am born in a brahmin clan,<br>
rich in grain and abundant wealth,<br>
joyful <span class='add'>and</span> honored by the king. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw793-794'></a> I was complete in every part,<br>
adorned with all the ornaments.<br>
<span class='add'>One time</span> standing in a window,<br>
I saw the Well-Gone-One at the<br>
city gate, Blazing Forth through Fame,<br>
Honored by Gods and by People,<br>
Ornamented with the <span class='add'>Great</span> Marks,<br>
Endowed with <span class='add'>Eighty</span> Lesser Marks. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25-26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw795'></a> Happy, with a heart that was thrilled,<br>
I chose <span class='add'>to seek</span> ordination.<br>
After not a very long time,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw796'></a> I’ve mastered the superpowers<br>
<span class='add'>like</span> the “divine ear” element.<br>
I know the hearts of others <span class='add'>too,</span><br>
I have done what the Teacher taught. <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw797'></a> I remember <span class='add'>my</span> former lives;<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> “divine eye” is purified.<br>
Throwing off all the defilements,<br>
I am purified, <span class='add'>I’m</span> stainless. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw798'></a> The Teacher’s been worshipped by me;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught.<br>
The heavy load has been laid down,<br>
the ties to existence severed. <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw799'></a> The reason for which I went forth,<br>
from <span class='add'>my</span> home into homelessness —<br>
I have <span class='add'>now</span> achieved that purpose:<br>
destruction of all the fetters. <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw800'></a> Then the Greatly Compassionate<br>
One placed me in <span class='add'>that</span> foremost place:<br>
The Supreme Man <span class='add'>said,</span> “Sakulā<br>
is foremost of ‘divine eye’ <span class='add'>nuns.</span>” <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw801'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw802'></a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw803'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
