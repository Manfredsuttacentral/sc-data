<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw131'></a> In the city, Bandhumatī,<br>
there was a king named Bandhuma.<br>
On the day of the full moon, he<br>
took on Full-Moon-Day observance. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw132'></a> At that time <span class='add'>I also lived</span> there;<br>
I was a water-jug slave-girl.<br>
Seeing the army, with the king,<br>
I reflected in this way then: <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw133'></a> The king himself, breaking his reign,<br>
took on Full-Moon-Day observance.<br>
Surely that karma’s bearing fruit:<br>
the populace is delighted. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw134'></a> Having considered thoroughly<br>
my bad rebirth and poverty,<br>
after gladdening <span class='add'>my</span> mind, I<br>
took on Full-Moon-Day observance. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw135'></a> Having observed the Full Moon Day<br>
in the Buddha’s dispensation,<br>
Due to that karma done very well,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw136'></a> There my well-made divine mansion<br>
welled up an <span class='add'>entire</span> league in height,<br>
appointed with fine gabled cells,<br>
decorated with large couches. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw137'></a> A <span class='add'>whole</span> lakh of celestial nymphs<br>
are always looking after me.<br>
Having surpassed the other gods,<br>
I outshine them all of the time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw138'></a> I was fixed in the chief queen’s place<br>
of sixty-four kings of the gods.<br>
I was fixed in the chief queen’s place<br>
of sixty-three wheel-turning kings. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw139'></a> Having a golden complexion,<br>
I transmigrated through lifetimes.<br>
Everywhere I am distinguished:<br>
fruit of Full-Moon-Day observance. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw140'></a> Elephant and horse carriages,<br>
and complete chariot riggings;<br>
I obtain every one of those:<br>
fruit of Full-Moon-Day observance. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw141'></a> Things made of gold, things of silver,<br>
also things made out of crystal,<br>
and likewise made of ruby too;<br>
I obtain all of those <span class='add'>fine things</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw142'></a> Silken garments and woolen ones,<br>
clothes made of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>khoma</i> and cotton,<br>
and <span class='add'>other</span> very costly clothes;<br>
I obtain all of those <span class='add'>fine things</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw143'></a> Food and drinks and solid foodstuffs,<br>
and likewise clothing, beds and chairs;<br>
I would obtain all those <span class='add'>items</span>:<br>
fruit of Full-Moon-Day observance. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw144'></a> Superb scents as well as garlands,<br>
<span class='add'>facial</span> powders and ointments too;<br>
I would obtain all that <span class='add'>make-up</span>:<br>
fruit of Full-Moon-Day observance. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw145'></a> Gabled cell-<span class='add'>adorned</span> palaces,<br>
pavilions, storied mansions, caves;<br>
I would obtain all those <span class='add'>dwellings</span>:<br>
fruit of Full-Moon-Day observance. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw146'></a> <span class='add'>When</span> I was <span class='add'>but</span> seven years old,<br>
I went forth into homelessness.<br>
When the eighth month <span class='add'>thence</span> had arrived,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw147'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
All <span class='add'>my</span> defilements are destroyed;<br>
now there will be no more rebirth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw148'></a> In the ninety-one aeons since<br>
I did that <span class='add'>good</span> karma back then,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
fruit of Full-Moon-Day observance. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw149'></a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw150'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
