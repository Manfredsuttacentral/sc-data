<h1>29. Ten Thousand Buddhist Nuns Headed Up by Yasovatī</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1029'></a> One hundred thousand aeons <span class='add'>and</span><br>
four incalculable <span class='add'>aeons</span><br>
hence, Dīpaṅkara, the Victor,<br>
the Leader of the World was born. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1030'></a> Dīpaṅkara, the Great Hero,<br>
the Guide, prophesied back then that<br>
Sumedha and Sumittā would<br>
be the same in pleasure and pain. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1031'></a> Seeing and going about in<br>
the world together with <span class='add'>its</span> gods,<br>
meeting us was included in<br>
<span class='add'>what Buddha</span> prophesied for them. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1032'></a> “You, <span class='add'>Sumedha,</span> will be all of<br>
our husbands met in the future;<br>
we’ll all be your desirable<br>
wives, saying what is dear <span class='add'>to you</span>.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1033'></a> All this alms-giving and morals,<br>
meditation cultivated;<br>
for a long time our everything<br>
has been abandoned, O Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1034'></a> Scents and ointments, garlands <span class='add'>and</span> lamps,<br>
which were fashioned out of <span class='add'>pure</span> gold,<br>
whatever it was we wished for,<br>
all was abandoned, O Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1035'></a> And other karma <span class='add'>we</span> have done,<br>
and <span class='add'>every</span> human enjoyment,<br>
for a long time our everything<br>
has been abandoned, O Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1036'></a> Transmigrating in varied births,<br>
much good karma was done by us;<br>
experiencing <span class='add'>you as</span> husband,<br>
transmigrating life after life, <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1037'></a> When <span class='add'>our</span> last lifetime was attained,<br>
in the home of the Śākyan prince,<br>
we arose in various clans,<br>
attractive celestial nymphs. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1038'></a> We’ve attained fame, with foremost gain;<br>
we’re worshipped and well-respected.<br>
We are always venerated,<br>
receiving things to eat and drink. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1039'></a> After abandoning the home,<br>
going forth into homelessness,<br>
when eight months had not yet elapsed,<br>
we all realized nirvana. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1040'></a> Always worshipped <span class='add'>and</span> respected,<br>
<span class='add'>we</span> receive things to eat and drink,<br>
and clothes <span class='add'>and also</span> lodgings <span class='add'>too;</span><br>
<span class='add'>folks</span> bring <span class='add'>us</span> all the requisites. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1041'></a> Our defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
we are living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1042'></a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for us.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>we have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1043'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>we have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>

<p>Thus indeed ten thousand Buddhist nuns headed up by Yasovatī spoke these verses face-to-face with the Blessed One.</p>
