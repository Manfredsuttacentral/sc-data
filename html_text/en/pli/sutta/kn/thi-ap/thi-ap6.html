<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw46'></a> In the city, Bandhumatī,<br>
there was a king named Bandhuma.<br>
I was <span class='add'>then</span> the wife of that king,<br>
behaving in a certain way. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw47'></a> Gone off alone, having sat down,<br>
I then reflected in this way:<br>
“I’ve done no wholesome <span class='add'>deeds</span> that <span class='add'>I</span><br>
can take <span class='add'>and</span> go <span class='add'>when I have died</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw48'></a> I have no doubt about the fact<br>
that I’ll certainly go to hell,<br>
blazingly hot, laden with grief,<br>
of frightful form, <span class='add'>and</span> very cruel.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw49'></a> After having approached the king,<br>
I <span class='add'>then</span> spoke these words <span class='add'>to him</span>:<br>
“O kṣatriyan, do give to me<br>
one monk, <span class='add'>whom</span> I will <span class='add'>thenceforth</span> feed.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw50'></a> That great king gave a monk to me,<br>
with cultivated faculties.<br>
After having taken his bowl,<br>
I satisfied <span class='add'>him</span> with milk-rice. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw51'></a> Having filled <span class='add'>it</span> up with milk-rice,<br>
I <span class='add'>applied some</span> scented ointment.<br>
Covering it with <span class='add'>some</span> netting,<br>
I closed <span class='add'>it</span> with a blue lotus. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw52'></a> Making that my object of thought<br>
for as long as <span class='add'>my</span> life <span class='add'>lasted</span>,<br>
bringing pleasure to <span class='add'>my</span> heart there,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw53'></a> I was fixed in the chief queen’s place<br>
of thirty kings among the gods.<br>
Whatever my mind wishes for<br>
comes into being as desired. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw54'></a> I was fixed in the chief queen’s place<br>
of twenty kings who turned the wheel.<br>
With accumulated <span class='add'>merit,</span><br>
I transmigrated through lifetimes. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw55'></a> I am set free from every bond;<br>
my substrata are gone away;<br>
all defilements are extinguished;<br>
now there will be no more rebirth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw56'></a> In the ninety-one aeons since<br>
I gave that almsgiving back then,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of food that’s begged for. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw57'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw58'></a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw59'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>

<p>Thus indeed Bhikkhunī Ekapiṇḍadāyikā spoke these verses.</p>
