<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw804'></a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
was a Master of Everything.<br>
<span class='add'>That</span> Leader arose in the world<br>
one hundred thousand aeons hence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw805'></a> The Admonisher, Instructor,<br>
Crosser-Over of all that breathe,<br>
Skilled at Preaching, <span class='add'>he</span>, the Buddha,<br>
caused many folks to cross <span class='add'>the flood</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw806'></a> Merciful, Compassionate One,<br>
Well-Wisher of all that breathe, he<br>
established in the five precepts<br>
all the rivals who had arrived. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw807'></a> In this way he was Unconfused<br>
and Very Well-Known by rivals,<br>
Ornamented by arahants<br>
who were masters <span class='add'>and</span> neutral ones. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw808'></a> The <span class='add'>body of the</span> Sage So Great<br>
rose up fifty-eight cubits <span class='add'>tall</span>;<br>
he was Valuable Like Gold,<br>
Bearing the Thirty-Two Great Marks. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw809'></a> <span class='add'>People’s</span> lifespan at that time was<br>
<span class='add'>fully</span> one hundred thousand years.<br>
Remaining <span class='add'>in the world</span> so long,<br>
he ferried many folks across. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw810'></a> I was born in Haṃsavatī,<br>
in a clan of millionaires then,<br>
glistening with various gems,<br>
endowed with supreme happiness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw811'></a> Having approached the Great Hero,<br>
I heard <span class='add'>him</span> preaching the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
ultimately sweet ambrosia<br>
which makes known the ultimate truth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw812-813'></a> Then after inviting <span class='add'>him, the</span><br>
Three-Worlds-Ender, with Assembly,<br>
giving him a large almsgiving,<br>
<span class='add'>feeling well-</span>pleased by <span class='add'>my</span> own hands,<br>
bowing <span class='add'>my</span> head to the Hero,<br>
the World’s Leader with Assembly,<br>
I aspired to that foremost place<br>
of Buddhist nuns who meditate. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9-10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw814'></a> Then the Untamed-Tamer, Master,<br>
Refuge for the Three Worlds, <span class='add'>Buddha,</span><br>
the Leopard of Men, prophesied:<br>
“you will receive that well-wished <span class='add'>place</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw815'></a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw816'></a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
the one known by the name Nandā,<br>
will be the Teacher’s follower.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw817'></a> At that time being overjoyed,<br>
as long as life, heart <span class='add'>full of</span> love,<br>
I attended on the Victor,<br>
the Guide, providing requisites. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw818'></a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw819'></a> Fallen thence, I went to Yāma,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> then I went to Tusita,<br>
and then to Nimmānarati,<br>
and then Vāsavatti City. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw820'></a> In whichever place I’m reborn,<br>
in accordance with that karma,<br>
everyplace I was made chief queen<br>
of <span class='add'>the gods who were</span> the kings <span class='add'>there</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw821'></a> Fallen thence, in the human state,<br>
<span class='add'>everyplace</span> I was made chief queen<br>
of kings who turn the wheel <span class='add'>of law,</span><br>
and <span class='add'>powerful</span> regional kings. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw822'></a> Having experienced success,<br>
among gods as well as humans,<br>
becoming happy everywhere,<br>
I transmigrated for aeons. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw823'></a> When <span class='add'>my</span> last rebirth was attained,<br>
I was the blameless daughter of<br>
King Suddhodana, <span class='add'>living in</span><br>
delightful Kapilavastu. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw824'></a> Seeing <span class='add'>my</span> splendor <span class='add'>and</span> beauty,<br>
that <span class='add'>Śākyan</span> clan was rejoicing.<br>
Therefore they gave the name “Nandā,”<br>
pleasant <span class='add'>and</span> excellent, to me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw825'></a> <span class='add'>I was</span> renowned as “the Beauty”<br>
among all of the young women<br>
in that same delightful city,<br>
except <span class='add'>of course</span> Yasodharā. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw826'></a> <span class='add'>My</span> eldest brother’s the Buddha,<br>
the middle one’s likewise a saint;<br>
staying alone in the lay life,<br>
I am exhorted by mother: <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw827'></a> “Child, you’re born in the Śākyan clan,<br>
following after the Buddha.<br>
Why do you sit <span class='add'>there</span> in the house,<br>
being bereft of <span class='add'>all your</span> joy? <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw828'></a> Thought impure is youthful beauty,<br>
under the power of old age;<br>
even a life which is healthy,<br>
ends in disease, ends in dying. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw829'></a> Look at even your <span class='add'>own</span> fine form:<br>
charming, distracting to the mind,<br>
it’s adorned and ornamented<br>
like Goddess Fortune embellished, <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw830'></a> like concentrated world-essence<br>
medicinal balm for the eyes,<br>
generating praise for merit,<br>
rejoicing the Okkāka clan; <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw831'></a> in no long time at all, old age<br>
is going to overpower <span class='add'>it</span>.<br>
Young one, abandoning the house,<br>
choose the Teaching, O blameless one.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw832'></a> After hearing <span class='add'>my</span> mother’s words,<br>
I went forth into homelessness<br>
in body, but not in <span class='add'>my</span> heart,<br>
<span class='add'>still</span> enthralled by youth and beauty. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw833'></a> Mother said to make my basis<br>
through study of the altered states,<br>
<span class='add'>pursuing it</span> with great effort.<br>
I was not enthused about that. <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw834-835'></a> Then the Great Compassionate One<br>
saw me enthralled by sense pleasures.<br>
To make me weary of beauty,<br>
through his own majestic power,<br>
the Victor conjured up, in my<br>
line of sight, a woman who shined;<br>
she was gorgeous, truly brilliant,<br>
even more beautiful than I. <a class='vjw' id='vjw31-32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw836'></a> And I, astonished, seeing her<br>
very astonishing body,<br>
thought <span class='add'>to myself,</span> “fruitful <span class='add'>today</span><br>
is the receipt of human eyes.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw837'></a> I said to her, “O lucky one!<br>
Tell me the story how you’ve come,<br>
and if you please, do tell to me<br>
<span class='add'>your</span> clan, <span class='add'>your</span> name, <span class='add'>your</span> family.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw838'></a> “No time for questions, lucky one;<br>
let me lay <span class='add'>my head</span> in <span class='add'>your</span> lap.”<br>
As though sinking into my limbs<br>
she reclined well for a moment. <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw839'></a> Then putting <span class='add'>her</span> head in my lap<br>
she with lovely eyes stretched out <span class='add'>there</span>.<br>
A spider, very venomous,<br>
landed on that <span class='add'>woman’s</span> forehead. <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw840'></a> When <span class='add'>it</span> had fallen onto her,<br>
boils formed <span class='add'>all over her body</span>;<br>
popping open, they were oozing<br>
putrid <span class='add'>chunks of</span> pus mixed with blood. <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw841'></a> And <span class='add'>her</span> face was disfigured too,<br>
with the putrid stench of a corpse;<br>
and <span class='add'>her</span> body festered too,<br>
<span class='add'>now</span> swollen up and <span class='add'>turning</span> blue. <a class='vjw' id='vjw38'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw842'></a> With all of her limbs quivering,<br>
gasping for every breath she took,<br>
making known her own suffering,<br>
she piteously wailed <span class='add'>like this:</span> <a class='vjw' id='vjw39'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw843'></a> “I’m afflicted with affliction,<br>
feeling <span class='add'>agonizing</span> feelings;<br>
I’m sunk down in great affliction.<br>
Be a refuge for me, O friend.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw40'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw844'></a> “Where is <span class='add'>that</span> facial shine of yours?<br>
Where is your <span class='add'>attractive</span> long nose?<br>
Your excellent copper-red lips?<br>
Where has your <span class='add'>beautiful</span> face gone? <a class='vjw' id='vjw41'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw845'></a> Where’s <span class='add'>your</span> mouth, shining like the moon?<br>
Where has your conch-shell-shaped neck gone?<br>
And <span class='add'>both</span> your ears, swaying like swings,<br>
have <span class='add'>now</span> become <span class='add'>badly</span> discolored. <a class='vjw' id='vjw42'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw846'></a> Your milk-laden <span class='add'>breasts shaped</span> like jugs<br>
which resembled pointy <span class='add'>young</span> buds<br>
have popped open; you’ve become a<br>
putrid corpse with a horrid stench. <a class='vjw' id='vjw43'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw847'></a> <span class='add'>Your</span> slender middle <span class='add'>and</span> buttocks,<br>
meat-stall where wounds and sins are born<br>
<span class='add'>are now</span> adorned with excrement.<br>
O! Beauty is not eternal! <a class='vjw' id='vjw44'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw848'></a> Every born body <span class='add'>is the same:</span><br>
putrid-smelling and frightening,<br>
like a loathsome cemetery,<br>
where <span class='add'>only</span> fools <span class='add'>find their</span> delight.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw45'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw849'></a> Then the Great Compassionate One,<br>
my brother, Leader of the World,<br>
Having seen me, moved in <span class='add'>my</span> heart,<br>
he spoke these verses <span class='add'>to me then:</span> <a class='vjw' id='vjw46'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw850'></a> “Nanda, look at <span class='add'>your own</span> body,<br>
<span class='add'>also</span> a sick <span class='add'>and</span> putrid corpse.<br>
Through disgustingness cultivate<br>
<span class='add'>your</span> mind, well-composed and tranquil. <a class='vjw' id='vjw47'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw851'></a> Just as is this, so too is that;<br>
just as is that, so too is this:<br>
putrid <span class='add'>and</span> emitting a stench,<br>
causing delight <span class='add'>only</span> to fools. <a class='vjw' id='vjw48'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw852'></a> Considering that in this way,<br>
industrious by day and night,<br>
you will see with your own wisdom,<br>
having turned away in disgust. <a class='vjw' id='vjw49'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw853'></a> After that I was deeply moved,<br>
having heard <span class='add'>those</span> well-said verses;<br>
remaining there, being at peace,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship. <a class='vjw' id='vjw50'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw854'></a> Everyplace where I am seated,<br>
I <span class='add'>reach</span> the highest altered states.<br>
The Victor, pleased by <span class='add'>my</span> virtue,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> placed me in that foremost place. <a class='vjw' id='vjw51'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw855'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw52'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw856'></a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw53'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw857'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw54'></a></p>

<p>Thus indeed Bhikkhunī Nandā spoke these verses.</p>
