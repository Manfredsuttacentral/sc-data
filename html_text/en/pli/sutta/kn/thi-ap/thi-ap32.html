<h1>32. Eighty-Four Thousand Brahmin Maiden Buddhist Nuns</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1116'></a> O Great Sage, in your city are<br>
eighty-four thousand <span class='add'>young women,</span><br>
with <span class='add'>very</span> tender hands <span class='add'>and</span> feet,<br>
who have been born in brahmin clans. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1117'></a> O Great Sage, in your city are<br>
many maidens from every land,<br>
born in Vaiśya and Śudra clans,<br>
and gods, snake<span class='add'>-gods</span> and <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kinnaras</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1118'></a> Some of them <span class='add'>already</span> went forth;<br>
many have insight into truth;<br>
the gods, <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kinnaras</i> and snake<span class='add'>-gods</span><br>
will enjoy <span class='add'>this</span> in the future. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1119'></a> Experiencing every fame,<br>
achieving every achievement,<br>
<span class='add'>those who’ve</span> obtained pleasure in you<br>
will enjoy <span class='add'>it</span> in the future. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1120'></a> And we’re the daughters of brahmins,<br>
who have been born in brahmin clans.<br>
Out of our desire, Great Sage,<br>
we worship <span class='add'>your</span> feet, Eyeful One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1121'></a> All existences have been reached,<br>
cravings are torn out by the roots;<br>
latent tendencies are cut off,<br>
merit<span class='add'>-based</span> aggregates broken. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1122'></a> All pasture in meditation,<br>
likewise have mastered altered states;<br>
we will always live delighting<br>
in the Teaching through altered states. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1123'></a> The ties to being, ignorance,<br>
the aggregates, too, are cast off.<br>
We’re born, O Leader, having gone<br>
on the path very hard to see. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1124'></a> “For a long time you have been my<br>
servants, doing what’s to be done.<br>
Cutting off the doubts of many,<br>
may you all go to nirvana.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1125'></a> Having worshipped the Sage’s feet,<br>
they performed <span class='add'>their</span> superpowers.<br>
Some are showing <span class='add'>very bright light,</span><br>
and after that making <span class='add'>it</span> dark. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1126'></a> They are showing the moon <span class='add'>and</span> sun,<br>
and the <span class='add'>great</span> ocean with <span class='add'>its</span> fish;<br>
they’re showing Mount Meru and the<br>
Coral Tree <span class='add'>in heaven,</span> girdled. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1127'></a> Through superpower they’re showing<br>
Tāvatiṃsa and Yāma spheres,<br>
Tusitā <span class='add'>and</span> Nimmitā gods,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> the Vasavatti great lords. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1128'></a> Some are showing the Brahmā <span class='add'>gods</span><br>
and a very costly walkway;<br>
making <span class='add'>themselves</span> look like Brahmā,<br>
they preach the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i> that’s empty. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1129'></a> Doing varied transformations,<br>
showing Buddha superpowers,<br>
they all demonstrated <span class='add'>their</span> strength,<br>
<span class='add'>then they</span> worshipped the Teacher’s feet. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1130'></a> We’ve mastered the superpowers<br>
<span class='add'>like</span> the “divine ear” element.<br>
We’re also the masters, Great Sage,<br>
of the knowledge in others’ hearts. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1131'></a> We remember <span class='add'>our</span> former lives;<br>
<span class='add'>our</span> “divine eye<span class='add'>s</span>” are purified.<br>
All the defilements are destroyed;<br>
<span class='add'>we</span> will not be reborn again. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1132'></a> In meaning and in the Teaching,<br>
etymology and preaching,<br>
<span class='add'>this</span> knowledge of ours was produced<br>
in your presence, O Great Hero. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1133'></a> Our meeting with <span class='add'>all</span> the Buddhas,<br>
the World-Lords, was displayed <span class='add'>to you</span>;<br>
our extensive service <span class='add'>to them</span><br>
was for the sake of you, Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1134'></a> O Sage, recall the good karma,<br>
which formerly <span class='add'>was done</span> by us;<br>
<span class='add'>that</span> merit was heaped up by us<br>
for the sake of you, Great Hero. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1135'></a> One hundred thousand aeons hence<br>
Padumuttara was the Sage.<br>
The city named Haṃsavatī<br>
was the home of <span class='add'>that</span> Buddha’s clan. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1136'></a> The Ganges River always flows<br>
past the gate of Haṃsavatī.<br>
Buddhist monks are troubled by the<br>
river, unable to proceed. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1137'></a> A day, <span class='add'>then</span> two, and then <span class='add'>it’s</span> three,<br>
after that a week, <span class='add'>next</span> a month,<br>
then fully four months \[might pass for<br>
those monks\], unable to proceed. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1138'></a> Then the future Buddha was a<br>
local leader, named Jaṭila.<br>
Seeing <span class='add'>those</span> stranded Buddhist monks<br>
he made a bridge on the river. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1139'></a> Then, with a hundred thousand <span class='add'>spent,</span><br>
the bridge on the river made, he<br>
made a monastery for the<br>
Assembly on the nearer bank. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1140'></a> The women as well as the men,<br>
from clans of high <span class='add'>and</span> low status,<br>
provided <span class='add'>funds for</span> equal shares<br>
in his bridge and monastery. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1141'></a> We and the other women <span class='add'>too,</span><br>
in the city and countrysides,<br>
who had minds that were very clear,<br>
were <span class='add'>rightful</span> heirs of that karma. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1142'></a> Women <span class='add'>and</span> men and boys <span class='add'>as well,</span><br>
and also numerous young girls,<br>
<span class='add'>joined together</span> to spread <span class='add'>clean</span> sand,<br>
for his bridge and monastery. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1143'></a> Sweeping the roadway, making flags,<br>
plantain-banners, pots of plenty,<br>
and having honored the Teacher<br>
with incense, cunnam and garlands, <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1144'></a> having made the monastery<br>
and the bridge, inviting the Guide,<br>
after giving extensive alms,<br>
he aspired to Awakening. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1145'></a> Padumuttara, Great Hero,<br>
Crosser-Over of all that breathe,<br>
the Great Sage made <span class='add'>his</span> thanksgiving<br>
to <span class='add'>bodhisattva</span> Jaṭila: <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1146'></a> “Undergoing life after life,<br>
when one hundred thousand <span class='add'>aeons</span><br>
have passed, <span class='add'>in</span> the “lucky” aeon,<br>
he will attain Awakening. <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1147'></a> These men and women who’ve arranged<br>
by hand what work was to be done,<br>
will all in futures yet to come<br>
be <span class='add'>born together</span> face-to-face. <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1148'></a> As the result of that karma,<br>
<span class='add'>done</span> with intention and resolve,<br>
reborn in heavens of the gods,<br>
they will <span class='add'>all</span> be your attendants.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1149'></a> Transmigrating life after life,<br>
a long time we experienced<br>
countless <span class='add'>years of</span> divine pleasure<br>
and countless <span class='add'>such</span> human <span class='add'>rebirths</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1150'></a> For one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
well-done karma’s attainment, we’re<br>
tender girls among men; likewise<br>
in the superb city of gods. <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1151'></a> Beautiful, wealthy and famous,<br>
and also praised and respected,<br>
we are constantly receiving<br>
<span class='add'>that</span> well-done karma’s attainment. <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1152'></a> When <span class='add'>our</span> last rebirth was attained,<br>
we are born in a brahmin clan,<br>
with <span class='add'>very</span> tender hands <span class='add'>and</span> feet,<br>
in the home of the Śākyan prince. <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1153'></a> We are never seeing the earth<br>
when it is undecorated,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> we do not see muddy roads<br>
<span class='add'>when they</span> have not been cleaned, Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw38'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1154'></a> When we were living in the house,<br>
we were respected all the time;<br>
they’re always bringing everything,<br>
through the strength of our past karma. <a class='vjw' id='vjw39'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1155'></a> After abandoning <span class='add'>our</span> homes,<br>
going forth into homelessness,<br>
we have crossed the road of rebirth;<br>
we have become free of passion. <a class='vjw' id='vjw40'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1156'></a> All the time they are bringing us<br>
monastic robes and alms to eat,<br>
requisites <span class='add'>as well as</span> lodgings,<br>
by the thousands and more and more. <a class='vjw' id='vjw41'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1157'></a> Our defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
we are living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw42'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1158'></a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for us.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>we have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw43'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1159'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>we have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw44'></a></p>
