<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw733'></a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
was a Master of Everything.<br>
<span class='add'>That</span> Leader arose in the world<br>
one hundred thousand aeons hence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw734'></a> I then <span class='add'>lived</span> in Haṃsavatī,<br>
<span class='add'>born</span> in an undistinguished clan.<br>
I worked for others, governed by<br>
morality, intelligent. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw735'></a> Sujāta, foremost follower<br>
of Padumuttara Buddha,<br>
departing the monastery,<br>
was going begging for alms-food. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw736'></a> I was then a water-bearer,<br>
going carrying a pitcher.<br>
Seeing him I gave <span class='add'>him some</span> soup,<br>
<span class='add'>feeling well-</span>pleased by <span class='add'>my</span> own hands. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw737'></a> Having accepted <span class='add'>that from me,</span><br>
he sat down <span class='add'>there and</span> enjoyed it.<br>
After leading him to that house,<br>
I gave <span class='add'>some</span> solid food to him. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw738'></a> Then my employer, being pleased,<br>
made <span class='add'>me</span> his own daughter-in-law.<br>
Going with <span class='add'>my</span> mother-in-law,<br>
I worshipped <span class='add'>him,</span> the Sambuddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw739'></a> Then he extolled a Buddhist nun<br>
who was a preacher of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>.<br>
He placed <span class='add'>her</span> in that foremost place;<br>
hearing that I was delighted. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw740'></a> Then, inviting the Well-Gone-One,<br>
World’s Leader with the Assembly,<br>
giving <span class='add'>them</span> a large almsgiving,<br>
I aspired to <span class='add'>attain</span> that place. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw741-742'></a> Then the Well-Gone-One said to me,<br>
with the sweet sound of a cymbal:<br>
“O one who’s fond of serving me,<br>
O servant of the Assembly,<br>
O hearer of the good Teaching,<br>
proper one, mind set on virtue,<br>
O lucky one, be overjoyed:<br>
you will attain your wish’s fruit. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9-10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw743'></a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw744'></a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
the one whose name’s Dhammadinnā<br>
will be the Teacher’s follower.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw745'></a> At that time being overjoyed,<br>
as long as life, heart <span class='add'>full of</span> love,<br>
I attended on the Victor,<br>
the Guide, providing requisites. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw746'></a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw747'></a> In this <span class='add'>present</span> lucky aeon<br>
Brahma’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,<br>
<span class='add'>the Buddha</span> known as Kassapa<br>
was born, the Best of Debaters. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw748'></a> The attendant of the Great Sage<br>
was the ruler of men back then,<br>
the king of Kāsi, named Kiki,<br>
in Benares, greatest city. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw749'></a> I was his sixth <span class='add'>royal</span> daughter,<br>
well-known by the name Sudhammā.<br>
Hearing the Best Victor’s Teaching,<br>
I chose <span class='add'>to seek</span> ordination. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw750-751'></a> Our father did not permit it;<br>
we <span class='add'>stayed</span> at home during that time,<br>
comfortable royal maidens<br>
doing <span class='add'>our</span> practice with vigor<br>
in virginal celibacy,<br>
for twenty times a thousand years,<br>
fond of waiting on the Buddha,<br>
<span class='add'>the king’s</span> seven joyful daughters. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18-19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw752'></a> Samaṇī, and Samaṇaguttā,<br>
Bhikkhunī, Bhikkhadāyikā,<br>
Dhammā, and also Sudhammā,<br>
and seventh Saṅghadāyikā, <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw753'></a> <span class='add'>now</span> Khemā Uppalavaṇṇā,<br>
Paṭācārā and Kuṇḍalā,<br>
<span class='add'>Kisā</span>gotamī, also I,<br>
and Visākhā is the seventh. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw754'></a> Due to those karmas done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw755'></a> And now, in <span class='add'>my</span> final rebirth,<br>
I’m born in a millionaire’s clan,<br>
rich, endowed with every pleasure,<br>
in Rajgir, excellent city. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw756'></a> When I’d become a young woman,<br>
possessing the virtue of beauty,<br>
married to another <span class='add'>good</span> clan,<br>
I dwelt endowed with happiness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw757'></a> Having approached the World’s Refuge,<br>
having heard <span class='add'>his</span> <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-preaching,<br>
through the Buddha, my husband gained<br>
the fruit of a non-returner. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw758'></a> Then I, having been permitted,<br>
went forth into homelessness <span class='add'>too.</span><br>
After not a very long time,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw759'></a> Then a layman, approaching me,<br>
asked <span class='add'>me a series of</span> questions<br>
<span class='add'>which were very</span> deep and subtle;<br>
I explained all of them <span class='add'>to him</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw760-761'></a> The Victor, pleased by <span class='add'>my</span> virtue,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> placed me in that foremost place,<br>
Buddhist nun, preacher of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>: “I see no other one who is<br>
as wise as is Dhammadinnā;<br>
so should you consider <span class='add'>her,</span> monks.”<br>
“I am indeed a wise woman,<br>
who was pitied by the Leader. <a class='vjw' id='vjw28-29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw762'></a> The Teacher’s been worshipped by me;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught.<br>
The heavy load has been laid down,<br>
the ties to existence severed. <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw763'></a> The reason for which I went forth,<br>
from <span class='add'>my</span> home into homelessness —<br>
I have <span class='add'>now</span> achieved that purpose:<br>
destruction of all the fetters. <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw764'></a> I’ve mastered the superpowers<br>
<span class='add'>like</span> the “divine ear” element.<br>
I know the hearts of others <span class='add'>too,</span><br>
I have done what the Teacher taught. <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw765'></a> I remember <span class='add'>my</span> former lives;<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> “divine eye” is purified.<br>
Throwing off all the defilements,<br>
I am purified, <span class='add'>I’m</span> stainless. <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw766'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw767'></a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw768'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
