<p><a class='jw' id='jw1214'></a> Ninety-one aeons ago the<br>
Leader, whose name was Vipassi,<br>
arose, the One Good to Look At,<br>
the One with Eyes for Everything. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1215'></a> I was then in Bandhumatī,<br>
born in an undistinguished clan.<br>
Having heard the Sage’s Teaching,<br>
I went forth into homelessness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1216'></a> Learned bearer of the Teaching,<br>
good preacher, varied discourser,<br>
I was a <span class='add'>nun</span> who practiced the<br>
dispensation of the Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1217'></a> Then giving many <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-talks<br>
with friendship to the populace,<br>
fallen from there I was reborn,<br>
full of splendor, in Tusitā. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1218'></a> Thirty-one aeons hence, Sikhi,<br>
a Heap of Fire, burning with fame,<br>
the Victor, the Best Debater,<br>
<span class='add'>the Buddha,</span> arose in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1219'></a> At that very time going forth,<br>
skilled in Buddha’s dispensation,<br>
making the Victor’s sayings shine,<br>
I then went to the thirty <span class='add'>gods</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1220'></a> The Leader <span class='add'>named</span> Vessabhu, <span class='add'>too,</span><br>
arose thirty-one aeons hence.<br>
And then as well I was the same:<br>
<span class='add'>a Buddhist nun</span> with vast knowledge. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1221'></a> Gone forth, a <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-bearer, I<br>
made Buddha’s dispensation shine.<br>
Gone to the lovely gods’ city,<br>
I experienced great comfort. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1222'></a> In this <span class='add'>present</span> lucky aeon,<br>
Kakusandha, Supreme Victor,<br>
arose, the Excellent Leopard,<br>
and then as well I was the same. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1223'></a> Gone forth, <span class='add'>I</span> illuminated<br>
the Sage’s thought, as long as life.<br>
Fallen from there, I went as far<br>
as the sphere of the thirty <span class='add'>gods</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1224'></a> <span class='add'>And</span> in this very same aeon<br>
the Leader Konāgamana<br>
arose <span class='add'>next,</span> the Excellent Lamp,<br>
Ultimate among all beings. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1225'></a> At that time too, going forth in<br>
the Neutral One’s dispensation,<br>
learned bearer of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>, I<br>
made Buddha’s dispensation shine. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1226'></a> Also in this <span class='add'>lucky</span> aeon<br>
Kassapa <span class='add'>Buddha,</span> Seventh Sage,<br>
arose, the Refuge of the World,<br>
Non-Hostile One, Ender of Death. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1227'></a> Gone forth in the dispensation<br>
of that Hero Among Men as well,<br>
<span class='add'>I</span> learned the good Teaching by heart,<br>
was confident in inquiry, <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1228'></a> very moral, also modest,<br>
<span class='add'>very</span> skilled in the three trainings,<br>
giving many talks on <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i><br>
with friendship as long as I lived. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1229'></a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1230'></a> And now, in <span class='add'>my</span> final rebirth,<br>
in Giribbaja, best city,<br>
<span class='add'>I was</span> born to rich millionaires,<br>
with a huge quantity of gems. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1231'></a> When <span class='add'>Gotama,</span> the World’s Leader,<br>
surrounded by one thousand monks,<br>
entered <span class='add'>the city,</span> Rajgir, he<br>
was praised by the thousand-eyed <span class='add'>god:</span> <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1232'></a> “The Restrained One, with former ascetics restrained;<br>
the Liberated One, with those liberated;<br>
<span class='add'>who had</span> the same color as a coin made of gold,<br>
the Blessed One entered Rajagaha city.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1233'></a> Seeing the Buddha’s majesty,<br>
and hearing him, Heap of Virtues,<br>
pleasing my heart in the Buddha,<br>
I worshipped <span class='add'>him</span> with all <span class='add'>my</span> strength. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1234'></a> At <span class='add'>some</span> moment after that, in<br>
the presence of Dhammadinnā,<br>
having gone forth from <span class='add'>my own</span> home,<br>
I went forth into homelessness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1235'></a> I destroyed <span class='add'>all</span> the defilements<br>
while <span class='add'>my</span> hair was being cut off.<br>
Going forth, in no long time, I learned<br>
<span class='add'>Buddha’s</span> entire dispensation. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1236'></a> After that I preached the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i><br>
in a huge gathering of folks.<br>
While <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i> was being preached, there<br>
was insight into the Teaching. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1237'></a> Seeing varied thousands of folks<br>
<span class='add'>achieving insight,</span> astonished,<br>
a spirit, very pleased by me,<br>
roaming about Rajgir <span class='add'>said this</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1238'></a> “Why are these people in Rajgir<br>
acting like nymphs drunk on honey,<br>
unless they’re honoring Sukkā,<br>
<span class='add'>who’s</span> preaching the ambrosial state? <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1239'></a> Methinks the wise are drinking that<br>
irresistible and unmixed<br>
strength-bestower, like travelers<br>
<span class='add'>drink rainwater from</span> a raincloud.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1240'></a> I’ve mastered the superpowers<br>
<span class='add'>like</span> the “divine ear” element.<br>
I’m also a master, Great Sage,<br>
of the knowledge in others’ hearts. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1241'></a> I remember <span class='add'>my</span> former lives;<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> “divine eye” is purified.<br>
All the defilements are destroyed;<br>
<span class='add'>I</span> will not be reborn again. <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1242'></a> In meaning and in the Teaching,<br>
etymology and preaching,<br>
<span class='add'>this</span> knowledge of mine was produced<br>
in your presence, O Great Hero. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1243'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1244'></a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1245'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
