<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1271'></a> In this <span class='add'>present</span> lucky aeon,<br>
Brahma’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,<br>
<span class='add'>the Buddha</span> known as Kassapa<br>
was born, the Best of Debaters. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1272'></a> At that time, having been ordained<br>
in that Buddha’s dispensation,<br>
I’m restrained in the five senses,<br>
and in monastic discipline. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1273-1274'></a> Moderate in eating, I was<br>
committed to being watchful,<br>
dwelling fixed on practice. One time<br>
<span class='add'>however,</span> with a filthy mind,<br>
I slandered an undefiled nun<br>
<span class='add'>by saying,</span> “<span class='add'>She’s</span> a prostitute.”<br>
Because of that evil karma,<br>
I roasted in a <span class='add'>fearful</span> hell. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3-4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1275'></a> Due to the rest of that karma,<br>
I was born in a clan of whores,<br>
repeatedly committing sins;<br>
and <span class='add'>then</span> in <span class='add'>my</span> final rebirth, <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1276'></a> I’m born among the Kāsians,<br>
in a millionaire’s clan. Due to<br>
<span class='add'>former</span> celibacy I was<br>
gorgeous, like a nymph among gods. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1277'></a> Seeing my extreme beauty, in<br>
Rajgir, best city, they made <span class='add'>me</span><br>
enter prostitution due to<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> formerly having slandered. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1278'></a> After hearing the good Teaching<br>
which was preached by the Best Buddha,<br>
endowed with former impressions,<br>
I went forth into homelessness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1279'></a> Seeking ordination having<br>
gone into the Victor’s presence,<br>
hearing that rogues were on the road,<br>
I got ordained by messenger. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1280'></a> All <span class='add'>my</span> karma has been burnt up,<br>
merit and likewise evil too;<br>
birth and rebirth crossed beyond,<br>
and prostitution’s thrown away. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1281'></a> I’ve mastered the superpowers<br>
<span class='add'>like</span> the “divine ear” element.<br>
I’m also a master, Great Sage,<br>
of the knowledge in others’ hearts. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1282'></a> I remember <span class='add'>my</span> former lives;<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> “divine eye” is purified.<br>
All the defilements are destroyed;<br>
<span class='add'>I</span> will not be reborn again. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1283'></a> In meaning and in the Teaching,<br>
etymology and preaching,<br>
<span class='add'>this</span> knowledge of mine was produced<br>
in your presence, O Great Hero. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1284'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1285'></a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1286'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
