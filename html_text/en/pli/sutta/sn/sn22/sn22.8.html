</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>At Savatthi. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you agitation through clinging and nonagitation through nonclinging. Listen to that and attend closely….</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“And how, bhikkhus, is there agitation through clinging? Here, bhikkhus, the uninstructed worldling regards form thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ That form of his changes and alters. With the change and alteration of form, there arise in him sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“He regards feeling thus … perception thus … volitional formations thus … consciousness thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ That consciousness of his changes and alters. With the change and alteration of consciousness, there arise in him sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“It is in such a way, bhikkhus, that there is agitation through clinging.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>“And how, bhikkhus, is there nonagitation through nonclinging? <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iii.19'></a> Here, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple does not regard form thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ That form of his changes and alters. With the change and alteration of form, there do not arise in him sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a>“He does not regard feeling thus … perception thus … volitional formations thus … consciousness thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ That consciousness of his changes and alters. With the change and alteration of consciousness, there do not arise in him sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a>“It is in such a way, bhikkhus, that there is nonagitation through nonclinging.”</p>
