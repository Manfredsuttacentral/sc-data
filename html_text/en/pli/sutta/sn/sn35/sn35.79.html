<h1>35.79. Abandoning Ignorance (1)</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One … and said to him: “Venerable sir, is there one thing through the abandoning of which ignorance is abandoned by a bhikkhu and true knowledge arises?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“There is one thing, bhikkhu, through the abandoning of which ignorance is abandoned by a bhikkhu and true knowledge arises.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“And what is that one thing, venerable sir?” <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iv.50'></a></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“Ignorance, bhikkhu, is that one thing through the abandoning of which ignorance is abandoned by a bhikkhu and true knowledge arises.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>“But, venerable sir, how should a bhikkhu know, how should he see, for ignorance to be abandoned by him and true knowledge to arise?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a>“Bhikkhu, when a bhikkhu knows and sees the eye as impermanent, ignorance is abandoned by him and true knowledge arises. When he knows and sees forms as impermanent … When he knows and sees as impermanent whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition … ignorance is abandoned by him and true knowledge arises.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a>“When, bhikkhu, a bhikkhu knows and sees thus, ignorance is abandoned by him and true knowledge arises.”</p>
