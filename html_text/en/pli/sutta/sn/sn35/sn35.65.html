<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. Then the Venerable</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>Samiddhi approached the Blessed One … and said to him: “Venerable sir, it is said, ‘Mara, Mara.’ In what way, venerable sir, might there be Mara or the description of Mara?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“Where there is the eye, Samiddhi, where there are forms, <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iv.39'></a> eye-consciousness, things to be cognized by eye-consciousness, there Mara exists or the description of Mara.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“Where there is the ear … the mind, where there are mental phenomena, mind-consciousness, things to be cognized by mind-consciousness, there Mara exists or the description of Mara.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>“Where there is no eye, Samiddhi, no forms, no eye-consciousness, no things to be cognized by eye-consciousness, there Mara does not exist nor any description of Mara.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a>“Where there is no ear … no mind, no mental phenomena, no mind-consciousness, no things to be cognized by mind-consciousness, there Mara does not exist nor any description of Mara.”</p>
