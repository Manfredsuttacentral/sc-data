<h1>11. The training rule on supporting a schism</h1>
</header>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><a class='pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli3.175'></a><a class='pts-vp-en' id='bd.1.304'></a><a class='pts-cs' id='bu-ss.11.1'></a><a class='ms-pa' id='ms-pa1704'></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. At that time Devadatta was pursuing schism in the monastic Order, a break in transmission. The monks were saying, “Devadatta doesn’t speak in accordance with the Teaching or the training. How can he pursue schism in the monastic Order?”</p>
<p>But Kokālika, Kaṭamodakatissaka, Khaṇḍadeviyā-putta, and Samuddadatta said to those monks, “Venerables, don’t say that. Devadatta does speak in accordance with the Teaching and the training. And he speaks with our consent and approval. He knows about us and speaks for us, and we agree to this.”</p>
<p>The monks of few desires … complained and criticized them, “How can these monks support Devadatta’s pursuit of schism in the monastic Order?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='ms-pa' id='ms-pa1705'></a> They rebuked those monks in many ways and then informed the Master. … He said, “Is it true, monks, that some monks support Devadatta’s pursuit of schism in the Order?”</p>
<p><a class='pts-vp-en' id='bd.1.305'></a> “It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha criticized them: “… Monks, how can those foolish men support Devadatta’s pursuit of schism in the Order? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='ms-pa' id='ms-pa1706'></a> <span class='rule'>‘That monk may have one, two, or three monks who take his side and support him, and they may say, “Venerables, don’t correct this monk. He speaks in accordance with the Teaching and the training. And he speaks with our consent and approval. He knows about us and speaks for us, and we agree to this.” The monks should say to those monks, “Venerables, don’t say that. This monk does not speak in accordance with the Teaching or the training. Don’t consent to schism in the monastic Order. Stay with the Order, for a united Order—in concord, in harmony, having a joint recitation—lives in comfort.” If those monks still continue as before, the monks should admonish them up to three times to make them stop. If they then stop, that is good. If not, they incur an offense entailing suspension.’”</span></p>

<p><span class='term'>Should admonish them:</span></p>
<div class='gloss'>
<p>“And, monks, they should be admonished in this way. A competent and capable monk should inform the Order:</p>

<p><a class='sc' id='sc12'></a><a class='ms-pa' id='ms-pa1715'></a> ‘Venerables, let the Order listen to me.

After each of the first two announcements, they commit a serious offense. When the last announcement is finished, they commit an offense entailing suspension. For those who commit the offense entailing suspension, the offense of wrong conduct and the serious offenses are annulled. Two or three can be admonished together, but not more than that.</p>
