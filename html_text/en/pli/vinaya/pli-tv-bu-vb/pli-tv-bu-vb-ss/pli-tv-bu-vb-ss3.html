<h1>3. The training rule on lewd speech</h1>
</header>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><a class='pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli3.128'></a><a class='pts-vp-en' id='bd.1.214'></a><a class='pts-cs-empty' id='bu-ss.3.1'></a><a class='pts-cs' id='bu-ss.3.1.1'></a><a class='ms-pa' id='ms-pa1133'></a> At one time, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time, Venerable Udāyī was staying in the wilderness, in a beautiful dwelling. Just then a number of women came to the monastery to see the dwellings. They approached Udāyī and said, “Venerable, we would like to see your dwelling.”</p>
<p>Then, after showing them his own dwelling, he praised and disparaged their private parts; he requested and implored, asked and enquired, described, instructed, and abused. Those women among them who were wanton and shameless flirted with Udāyī; they called out to him, laughed with him, and made fun of him. But, after leaving, those among them who had a sense of shame complained to the monks, “Venerables, this isn’t suitable and appropriate. We wouldn’t want to hear this from our own husbands, let alone from Venerable Udāyī.”</p>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='bu-ss.3.1.2'></a> The monks of few desires …<a class='pts-vp-en' id='bd.1.215'></a> complained and criticized him, “How can Venerable Udāyī speak lewdly to women?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='ms-pa' id='ms-pa1134'></a> They rebuked Udāyī in many ways and informed the Master. And the Master had the Order of monks assembled and questioned Udāyī, “Is it true, Udāyī, that you spoke lewdly to women?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked him, “It’s not suitable, foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a recluse, it’s not allowable, it should not to be done. How can you speak lewdly to women? Haven’t I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion, not for the sake of passion … for the stilling of the fevers of sense desire? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a> <span class='rule'>‘If a lustful monk speaks lewd words connected with sexual intercourse to a woman, as a young man might to a young woman, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”</span></p>

Api ca rattaṃ cittaṃ imasmiṃ atthe adhippetaṃ vipariṇatanti</i>; “distorted: a mind with desire is distorted, a mind with anger is distorted, a confused mind is distorted.
