<h1>15.9. Trance (iii.)</h1>

<p><a class='pc' id='pc299'></a><span class='add'>Controverted Point:</span> That a person may die while in a state of trance.</p>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs15.9.1'></a><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> You must, then, admit that, while in that state, he has all the <i>mental</i> symptoms betokening death—to wit, in mental contact, feeling, perception, volition, consciousness. But you agree that all moribund mental symptoms are absent. Hence your proposition falls through.</p>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs15.9.2'></a>You will further agree with this: not only that for one in a state of trance is all mental life in abeyance, but also that death is accompanied by contactual, emotional, volitional, and cognitive symptoms.</p>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs15.9.3'></a>Moreover, can poison, weapons, or fire affect the body of one in the attainment of a state of trance? You deny. You assert, on the contrary, that those causes of death cannot affect him. Then, can you maintain your proposition?</p>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs15.9.4'></a>Or do you now maintain that poison, weapons, or fire can affect his body? Then, is his attainment not genuine? …</p>
<p><span class='add'>Rājagirikas:</span> But in opposing my proposition you imply that there must be some principle of certainty (or uniformity) by which one is assured of not dying while in trance. If you say that such an assurance does not exist, your proposition cannot stand.</p>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs15.9.5'></a><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> But one who is enjoying visual consciousness is not dying, even though there be no uniform principle of certainty by which he is assured of being kept from death. Hence I assert as much of one who is in trance.</p>

<p><cite class='book' translate='no'>The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class='author'>Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class='author'>C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, <span class='publication-date'>1915</span>.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition were incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
