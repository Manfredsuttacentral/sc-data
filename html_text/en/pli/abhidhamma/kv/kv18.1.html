<h1>18.1. Of the Buddha and this World</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='pc' id='pc323'></a><span class='add'>Controverted Point:</span> That it is not right to say “The Exalted Buddha lived in the world of mankind.”</p>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.1.1'></a><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> But are there not shrines, parks, settlements, villages, towns, kingdoms, countries mentioned by the Buddha? <a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.1.2'></a> And was he not born at Lumbini, enlightened under the Bodhi tree? Was not the Dhamma-wheel set rolling by him at Benares? Did he not renounce the will to live at the Chāpāla shrine? Did he not complete existence at Kusinārā?</p>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.1.3'></a>Moreover, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“<i>Bhikkhus</i>, I was once staying at Ukkaṭṭhā in the Subhaga<a class='pc' id='pc324'></a> Wood by the King’s Sal Tree …” “… I was once staying at Uruvelā by the Goatherds’ Banyan before I was enlightened …” “… I was once staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Wood at the Squirrels’ Feeding-ground …” “… I was once staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Wood, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park …” “… I was once staying at Vesālī in the Great Wood at the Gable House Hall …”</p>
<p>Surely then the Exalted Buddha lived among men.</p>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.1.4'></a><span class='add'>Vetulyakas:</span> But did not the Exalted One say, “born in the world, enlightened in the world, live, having overcome the world, undefiled by the world?”</p>
<p>Hence it is surely not right to say “The Exalted Buddha lived in the world of mankind.”</p>

<p><cite class='book' translate='no'>The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class='author'>Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class='author'>C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, <span class='publication-date'>1915</span>.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition were incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
