<h1>3.4. Of Emancipation as a Process</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='pc' id='pc145'></a><span class='add'>Controverted Point:</span> That spiritual emancipation is a <span class='add'>gradual</span> process of becoming free.</p>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.4.1'></a><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> If your proposition is to stand, you must affirm also that such a mind is then in part freed, in part not. And if you assent to the second proposition, you must admit that your subject is part Stream-Winner, part not—in other words, that he has all the attributes of the Stream-Winner in part only.</p>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.4.2'></a><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.4.3'></a><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.4.4'></a>The same argument holds for the other three Paths.</p>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.4.5'></a>You must also affirm as to whether <span class='add'>each conscious unit</span> is emancipated at the moment of its genesis, and in process of being emancipated as it ceases … .</p>
<p><a class='pc' id='pc146'></a><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.4.6'></a> <span class='add'>Opponent:</span> You do not assent to my proposition; but was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“For him who thus knows, thus sees, the heart is set free from the defilements of sense-desires, of becoming, and of ignorance?”</p>
<p>Is there no “being emancipated” here of the emancipated mind?</p>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.4.7'></a><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> But is there not also a Suttanta in which the Exalted One said:</p>
<p>“With heart thus made serene, made wholly pure, and very clean, freed from lust and from defilement, become pliant, ready to work and imperturbable, he bends over the mind to insight in the destruction of defilements?”</p>
<p>There is no process here of being set free.</p>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.4.8'></a>You would not speak of a mind partially lusting, hating, being bewildered, being corrupted. How can you then maintain your proposition? Would you not say <span class='add'>straight away</span> that the mind is lustful or not, malevolent or not, confused or not, suspended or not, destroyed or not, finished or not?</p>

<p><cite class='book' translate='no'>The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class='author'>Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class='author'>C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, <span class='publication-date'>1915</span>.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition were incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
