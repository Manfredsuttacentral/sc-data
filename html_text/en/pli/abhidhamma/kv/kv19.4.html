<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.4.1'></a><i>Is similar to</i> <a class='cr' href='/kv19.3/en/aung-rhysdavids#pts-cs19.3.1'>PTS CS 19.3.1</a> <i>in the foregoing</i></p>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.4.2'></a><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.4.4'></a><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Again, do you imply that the winning <span class='add'>through gifts</span> of raiment, almsfood, lodging, medicine, is unconditioned? But if so, the same difficulty arises as in the case of attainment in general (<a class='cr' href='#pts-cs19.4.1'>PTS CS 19.4.1</a>). In fact, you would have in these four and <i>Nibbāna</i> five “unconditioneds.”</p>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.4.5'></a><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.4.6'></a>A similar argument is used for the winning of any of the Rūpa <i>jhānas</i> (4), or of the Arūpa <i>jhānas</i> (4), or of the Four Paths and Four Fruits, concluding with: In fact, you would have in these eight and <i>Nibbāna</i> nine “unconditioneds,” etc.</p>
<p><a class='pc' id='pc338'></a><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.4.7'></a> <span class='add'>Pubbaseliyas:</span> But if I am wrong, can you identify winning with any one of the five aggregates, bodily or mental?</p>
<p>If not, then it is unconditioned.</p>

<p><cite class='book' translate='no'>The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class='author'>Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class='author'>C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. Published by Pali Text Society, <span class='publication-date'>1915</span>.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by Bhikkhu Sujato, assisted by Jatin Patel and team from Hi-Tech Outsourcing, in 2013–2014. It contains several minor changes in terminology, the intent of which was to bring the translation in line with more commonly accepted renderings, while eliminating some ambiguities and archaisms. These were particularly apparent in the verses, so I have newly translated most of these. In addition, the corrections listed on pp. lv–lvi of the original edition were incorporated in the text. Much of the text is highly compressed, and is often a paraphrase rather than a translation. All notes and excerpts from the commentaries have been omitted, with the exception of the identification of schools, which is marked with each argument. These do not entail that these schools existed at the time of the Kathāvatthu’s composition.</p>
