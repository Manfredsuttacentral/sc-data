<h1>20. The Chapter about the Path</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='mc' id='358' data-uid='pdhp358'></a>The eightfold is the best of paths,<br>
four principles the best of truths,<br>
dispassion the best of states,<br>
the Visionary the best of men.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='359' data-uid='pdhp359'></a>The path was declared by me,<br>
the removal of the dart by knowledge,<br>
your duty is to have ardour declare the Realised Ones,<br>
entering this path meditators<br>
will be released from the bonds of Māra.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='360' data-uid='pdhp360'></a>This is the path, there is no other,<br>
for insight and for purity,<br>
you should enter upon this path,<br>
this is the confounding of Māra,<br>
having entered upon this path you will make an end to suffering.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='361' data-uid='pdhp361'></a>Cut down the forest of defilements not just the trees,<br>
from the forest arises a danger,<br>
having cut down the forest and thicket,<br>
you will go further without forests.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='362' data-uid='pdhp362'></a>For as long as an atom of desire<br>
of a man for his kin is not cut down,<br>
the mind is in bondage there,<br>
like a calf in bondage to mother’s milk.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='363' data-uid='pdhp363'></a>Cut off any affection for one’s self,<br>
like an autumn lotus plucked with the hand,<br>
develop fully the path to peace and<br>
Nibbāna taught by the Fortunate One.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='364' data-uid='pdhp364'></a>Here I will make the rains retreat, here during winter and summer,<br>
in just such a way a fool thinks, not understanding the danger.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='365' data-uid='pdhp365'></a>That person whose mind is attached and besotted<br>
by cattle and children,<br>
is snatched away by death<br>
just as a sleeping village by a great flood.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='366' data-uid='pdhp366'></a>Children are not a refuge, nor fathers, not even brothers,<br>
for one afflicted by the End-Maker there is no refuge in relatives.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='367' data-uid='pdhp367'></a>Relatives cry and wail together in this way<br>
people still depart, against their desires they give him up.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='368' data-uid='pdhp368'></a>Understanding this the sage, wise, free of selfishness,<br>
should constantly purify the path that is leading to heaven.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='369' data-uid='pdhp369'></a>Therefore a wise man looking for his own welfare<br>
should constantly purify the path that is leading to heaven.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='370' data-uid='pdhp370'></a>Endowed with faith and virtue,<br>
wise, well-composed,<br>
one constantly purifies the path,<br>
which brings safety in the next world.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='371' data-uid='pdhp371'></a>Endowed with faith and virtue,<br>
wise, composed,<br>
delights in practising the path,<br>
delights in internal peace.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='372' data-uid='pdhp372'></a>Endowed with faith and virtue,<br>
always delighting in being wise,<br>
one advances like burning fire against the fetter, small or large,<br>
whether it is wicked conceit or hypocrisy.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='373' data-uid='pdhp373'></a>All conditions are impermanent,<br>
when one sees this with wisdom,<br>
then one grows tired of suffering—<br>
this is the path to purity.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='374' data-uid='pdhp374'></a>All components of mind and body are without self,<br>
when one sees this with wisdom,<br>
then one grows tired of suffering—<br>
this is the path to purity.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='375' data-uid='pdhp375'></a>From effort originates wisdom,<br>
without effort wisdom is destroyed,<br>
having understood these two paths of development and decline,<br>
the sage should train so that his wisdom increases.</p>
