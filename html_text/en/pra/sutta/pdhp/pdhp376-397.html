hearing which one is brought to peace.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='377' data-uid='pdhp377'></a>One may speak a thousand verses consisting of useless words,<br>
better is one verse of Dhamma,<br>
hearing which one is brought to peace.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='378' data-uid='pdhp378'></a>One may conquer a thousand men a thousand times in a battle,<br>
but having conquered another, one’s self,<br>
one would surely be supreme in battle.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='379' data-uid='pdhp379'></a>One might give alms impartially with a thousand coins of money<br>
month by month for a hundred years;<br>

that worship is surely better than the hundred-year sacrifice.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='380' data-uid='pdhp380'></a>One person might care for the fire in the woods for a hundred years;<br>

<p><a class='mc' id='381' data-uid='pdhp381'></a>Whatever the alms or the sacrifice in the world<br>
the one seeking merit may give for a year,<br>
all that comes not to a quarter of the merit—<br>
better is the worship of the upright.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='382' data-uid='pdhp382'></a>One might give alms impartially with a thousand coins of money<br>

<p><a class='mc' id='385' data-uid='pdhp385'></a>One might give alms impartially with a thousand coins of money<br>
month by month for a hundred years;<br>
but that is not worth a sixteenth part<br>
of those who have mastered Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='386' data-uid='pdhp386'></a>From month to month the fool<br>
may eat food with the tip of <i>kusa</i> grass,<br>
but that is not worth a sixteenth part<br>
of having confidence in the Buddha.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='387' data-uid='pdhp387'></a>From month to month the fool<br>
may eat food with the tip of <i>kusa</i> grass,<br>

<p><a class='mc' id='390' data-uid='pdhp390'></a>One might live for a hundred years,<br>
unvirtuous and uncomposed,<br>

for one with virtue and meditation.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='391' data-uid='pdhp391'></a>One might live for a hundred years,<br>
lacking in wisdom and uncomposed,<br>

for one endowed with wisdom and meditation.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='392' data-uid='pdhp392'></a>One might live for a hundred years,<br>
indolent, with less energy,<br>
but a life of one day is better,<br>
for one with energy set up and firm.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='393' data-uid='pdhp393'></a>One might live for a hundred years,<br>
without seeing rise and fall,<br>
but a life of one day is better,<br>
for the one seeing rise and fall.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='394' data-uid='pdhp394'></a>One might live for a hundred years,<br>
without seeing the supreme state,<br>
but a life of one day is better,<br>
for one seeing the supreme state.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='395' data-uid='pdhp395'></a>One might live for a hundred years,<br>
without seeing the deathless state,<br>

having not attained the destruction of the pollutants,<br>
but a life of one day is better,<br>
for one who has attained the destruction of the pollutants.</p>
