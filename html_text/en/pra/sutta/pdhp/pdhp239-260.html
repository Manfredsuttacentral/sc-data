<h1>14. The Chapter about Patience</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatta'>
<p><a class='mc' id='239' data-uid='pdhp239'></a>Enduring patience is the supreme austerity,<br>
Nibbāna is supreme say the Buddhas,<br>
for one gone forth does not hurt another,<br>
nor does an ascetic harass another.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='240' data-uid='pdhp240'></a>Those sages without violence,<br>
constantly restrained in body,<br>
go to the deathless Nibbāna,<br>
having gone there they do not grieve.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='241' data-uid='pdhp241'></a>Gotama’s disciples always awake to a good wakening,<br>
those who day and night have a mind that delights in non-violence.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='242' data-uid='pdhp242'></a>Gotama’s disciples always awake to a good wakening,<br>
those who day and night have a mind that delights in cultivation.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='243' data-uid='pdhp243'></a>Gotama’s disciples always awake to a good wakening,<br>
those who day and night constantly have mindfulness of the body.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='244' data-uid='pdhp244'></a>Those wise ones intent on meditation,<br>
who delight in the peace of renunciation,<br>
even the gods are envious of them,<br>
the Sambuddhas, the ones who are mindful.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='245' data-uid='pdhp245'></a>Whether in the wilds or village, whether on low or on high ground,<br>
wherever the Arahats live, that ground is surely delightful.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='246' data-uid='pdhp246'></a>If, for even one living being, one with an uncorrupt mind,<br>
has loving-kindness, there is wholesomeness in that,<br>
but the one with compassion in mind for all living beings,<br>
that noble one makes abundant merit.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='247' data-uid='pdhp247'></a>Those who conquered the earth, crowded with beings,<br>
those royal seers who went round sacrificing:<br>
the horse sacrifice, the man sacrifice,<br>
the stick-casting, the soma offering, the unobstructed—<br>
compared to the one who develops his mind with loving-kindness,<br>
they do not partake of even a sixteenth part,<br>
just as the whole host of stars<br>
do not partake of the radiance of the moon.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='248' data-uid='pdhp248'></a>Then he who with a mind of loving-kindness<br>
has compassion for all living beings,<br>
having loving-kindness towards all beings,<br>
he has no one who is hated.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='249' data-uid='pdhp249'></a>For he who every day and night delights in a mind of non-violence,<br>
having loving-kindness towards all beings,<br>
he has no one who is hated.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='250' data-uid='pdhp250'></a>For he who every day and night<br>
has a mind that delights in cultivation,<br>
having loving-kindness towards all beings,<br>
he has no one who is hated.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='251' data-uid='pdhp251'></a>For he who every day and night<br>
constantly has mindfulness of the body,<br>
having loving-kindness towards all beings,<br>
he has no one who is hated.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='252' data-uid='pdhp252'></a>He who neither kills, nor has killed,<br>
conquers, nor has conquered,<br>
having loving-kindness towards all beings,<br>
he has no one who is hated.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='253' data-uid='pdhp253'></a>For not by hatred do hatreds cease at any time in this place,<br>
they only cease with non-hatred,<br>
this truth is surely eternal.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='254' data-uid='pdhp254'></a>The others do not understand that we should be successful here,<br>
but for those here who do understand,<br>
through that, their dissensions do cease.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='255' data-uid='pdhp255'></a>Let us live truly happily, without hatred,<br>
amongst those who have hatred,<br>
amongst humans who have hatred let us live without hatred.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='256' data-uid='pdhp256'></a>Let us live truly happily, without longing,<br>
amongst those who are longing,<br>
amongst humans who are longing let us live without longing.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='257' data-uid='pdhp257'></a>We live truly happily enough having no possessions ourselves,<br>
amongst those with possessions let us live having no possessions.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='258' data-uid='pdhp258'></a>One should see it as a bubble,<br>
one should see it as a mirage,<br>
looking on the world in this way<br>
the King of Death does not see one.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='259' data-uid='pdhp259'></a>This body is worn out, a nest of disease, perishing,<br>
the putrid body comes to destruction, for life ends in death.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='260' data-uid='pdhp260'></a>Having seen an old man, one afflicted and sick,<br>
having seen one deceased, after not long for the student,<br>
anxiety, sharp and extensive, arose,<br>
and the wise one cut the household bonds.</p>
