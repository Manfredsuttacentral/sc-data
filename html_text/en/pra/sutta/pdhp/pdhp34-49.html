<p><a class='mc' id='34' data-uid='pdhp34'></a>Strive and cut off the thread,<br>
remove continuity, brahmin,<br>
knowing the destruction of the conditioned,<br>
you are … brahmin</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='35' data-uid='pdhp35'></a>That one from whom one learned Dhamma,<br>
whether old or young,<br>
with respect bow down to him,<br>
like a brahmin bows at fire-sacrifice.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='36' data-uid='pdhp36'></a>That one from whom one learned Dhamma<br>
taught by the Perfect Sambuddha,<br>
you should honor him,<br>
like a brahmin honors the fire-sacrifice.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='37' data-uid='pdhp37'></a>Not because of matted hair,<br>
family or birth is one a true brahmin,<br>
he who wards off wickedness,<br>
small or great, in every way,<br>
through warding off wickedness,<br>
he is called a brahmin.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='38' data-uid='pdhp38'></a>Like water on the lotus leaf,<br>
like a mustard seed on a needle,<br>
he who is unsmeared by desires,<br>
that one I say is a brahmin.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='39' data-uid='pdhp39'></a>The sun is radiant when it rises,<br>
the moon shines by night,<br>
the accoutred noble is radiant,<br>
the meditating brahmin is radiant,<br>
yet during every day and night<br>
the Buddha is radiant through his power.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='40' data-uid='pdhp40'></a>For whom the near shore,<br>
the far shore or both do not exist,<br>
free of fever, detached,<br>
that one I say is a brahmin.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='41' data-uid='pdhp41'></a>When a brahmin has, through two things, crossed over,<br>
then, for one who knows,<br>
all the fetters are laid to rest.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='42' data-uid='pdhp42'></a>He who destroyed the fetter,<br>
destroyed conceit and continued existence,<br>
living in the Community, standing by Dhamma,<br>
the knowing one does not approach society.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='43' data-uid='pdhp43'></a>Whoever should speak a word of truth<br>
that is informed and is not coarse,<br>
through which no one would be cursed,<br>
that one I say is a brahmin.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='44' data-uid='pdhp44'></a>Whoever doesn’t mix with either householders or the houseless,<br>
wandering homeless, with few desires,<br>
that one I say is a brahmin.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='45' data-uid='pdhp45'></a>For whom there is no wrong-doing bodily, verbally or mentally,<br>
being restrained in these three things,<br>
that one I say is a brahmin.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='46' data-uid='pdhp46'></a>A brahmin should not hit a brahmin,<br>
nor should he abandon him,<br>
woe to the one who strikes a brahmin,<br>
and to the one who does not abandon him.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='47' data-uid='pdhp47'></a>Destroying mother first,<br>
and then two noble kings,<br>
destroying a kingdom and its followers,<br>
the brahmin lives untroubled.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='48' data-uid='pdhp48'></a>The deeply wise sagacious one,<br>
skilled in what is path and not path,<br>
who has reached the ultimate good,<br>
that one I say is a brahmin.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='49' data-uid='pdhp49'></a>The meditator sitting down, the one who is dustless,<br>
who has done his duty, without pollutants,<br>
who has reached the ultimate good,<br>
that one I say is a brahmin.</p>
