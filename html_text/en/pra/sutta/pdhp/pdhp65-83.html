<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='mc' id='65' data-uid='pdhp65'></a>Friends are good whenever need arises,<br>
at the break-up of life merit is good,<br>
being content with everything is good,<br>
the abandoning of all wickedness is good.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='66' data-uid='pdhp66'></a>Respecting one’s mother is good in the world,<br>
also respecting one’s father is good,<br>
respecting ascetics is good in the world,<br>
also respecting true brahmins is good.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='67' data-uid='pdhp67'></a>Virtuous conduct till old age is good,<br>
the establishing of faith is good,<br>
speech that is beneficial is good,<br>
the destruction of conceit is good.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='68' data-uid='pdhp68'></a>The arising of the Buddhas is good,<br>
the teaching of the Dhamma is good,<br>
the harmony of the Saṅgha is good,<br>
devotion to harmony is good.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='69' data-uid='pdhp69'></a>Meeting with the noble is pleasant,<br>
living with good people is pleasant,<br>
through not meeting foolish people<br>
one will constantly be happy.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='70' data-uid='pdhp70'></a>For he who consorts with fools<br>
grieves for a long time,<br>
dwelling with fools is always suffering<br>
as it is with enemies,<br>
the wise ones dwell happily<br>
as with an assembly of kin.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='71' data-uid='pdhp71'></a>Therefore the firm and the learned,<br>
the virtuous, dutiful and noble—<br>
follow such a true and intelligent person<br>
as the moon follows the course of the stars.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='72' data-uid='pdhp72'></a>From love there arises grief,<br>
with love grief, with love fear,<br>
for one who is free from love<br>
there is no grief, how is there fear?</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='73-74' data-uid='pdhp73-74'></a>Do not associate at any time<br>
with those who are loved or with those unloved,<br>
there is suffering not meeting the loved one,<br>
and suffering from meeting the unloved one.<br>
Therefore do not hold anything as loved,<br>
for speaking of the loved is loathsome.<br>
There are no knots for those<br>
who hold nothing as loved or as unloved.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='75' data-uid='pdhp75'></a>Hunger is the supreme sickness,<br>
conditions are the supreme suffering,<br>
knowing this as it really is,<br>
know Nibbāna is the supreme good.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='76' data-uid='pdhp76'></a>Health is the supreme gain,<br>
content the supreme wealth,<br>
confidence the supreme kin,<br>
Nibbāna the supreme good.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='77' data-uid='pdhp77'></a>If, by renouncing a small good,<br>
he might see a good that is large,<br>
the wise one should renounce that small good,<br>
seeing the good that is extensive.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='78' data-uid='pdhp78'></a>For a human who is always mindful,<br>
knowing the measure in food received,<br>
his painful feelings become slight,<br>
he ages slowly, guarding his lifespan.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='79' data-uid='pdhp79'></a>A person of good breed is rare,<br>
that one is not born everywhere,<br>
wherever that hero is born,<br>
that family gains happiness.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='80' data-uid='pdhp80'></a>There are surely true people everywhere,<br>
the good do not talk of desiring sense-pleasures;<br>
when touched by pleasure or by suffering,<br>
true people are not elated or depressed.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='81' data-uid='pdhp81'></a>The victor generates hatred,<br>
the defeated one finds suffering,<br>
the one at peace lives happily,<br>
having abandoned victory and defeat.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='82' data-uid='pdhp82'></a>Pleasant are rivers with good fords,<br>
pleasant is the person conquered by Dhamma,<br>
the acquisition of faith is good,<br>
doing nothing wicked is good.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='83' data-uid='pdhp83'></a>It is pleasant to meet the virtuous,<br>
it is pleasant to meet the learned,<br>
it is pleasant to meet the Worthy Ones,<br>
who are free from attachments.</p>
